- Level-2 headings: 14 (minimum: 5) ✓
- Code examples: 16 (minimum: 3) ✓
- Source references: 6+ (minimum: 2) ✓

## Drift Issues Resolved
- High severity: 3/3 resolved
  - Removed incorrect cwd examples (not in WorkflowStepCommand)
  - Removed incorrect env examples (not in WorkflowStepCommand)
  - Removed incorrect on_exit_code examples (not in WorkflowStepCommand)
- Medium severity: 2/2 resolved
  - Clarified capture_output is the actual field (not deprecated capture)
  - Clarified capture_streams is planned/internal-only
- Low severity: 2/2 resolved
  - Added OnFailureConfig strategy field documentation
  - Improved capture_output explanation

## Code Validation
✓ All WorkflowStepCommand fields verified against src/config/command.rs:320-401
✓ All WorkflowStep internal fields documented in Technical Notes
✓ OnFailureConfig strategies verified against src/cook/workflow/on_failure.rs:9-22
✓ All examples use only fields available in WorkflowStepCommand
✓ Source references provided for all major features

## Quality Gates
✓ Meets minimum content requirements (449 lines vs 100 minimum)
✓ All critical issues resolved (removed incorrect field examples)
✓ All high severity issues resolved (corrected struct mismatches)
✓ All examples grounded in actual WorkflowStepCommand struct
✓ All source references validated and accurate
✓ Clear separation between user-facing and internal fields

## Key Corrections Made
1. Removed cwd/working_dir examples - field not in WorkflowStepCommand
2. Removed env examples - field not in WorkflowStepCommand
3. Removed on_exit_code examples - field not in WorkflowStepCommand
4. Added comprehensive OnFailure strategy documentation
5. Corrected capture vs capture_output confusion
6. Moved internal-only fields to Technical Notes section
7. Added source code references throughout
