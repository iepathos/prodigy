2. Added "Quick Start" section for immediate orientation
3. Added comprehensive "How It Works" section explaining MapReduce workflow
4. Documented all four workflow phases with source references
5. Added Worktree Isolation explanation
6. Added Quality Guarantees section
7. Fixed broken spec link

✓ Meets minimum content requirements (121 lines vs 100 minimum)
✓ All identified index.md issues resolved
✓ All examples grounded in codebase
✓ All source references validated
✓ All internal links verified

Status: READY TO COMMIT

Note: This is a multi-subsection chapter. The drift report identified 13 subsection-level
issues that should be handled by separate map agents. This commit improves only the
index.md file at the chapter level.
