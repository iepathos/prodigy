## Drift Issues Resolved
- Critical: 1/1 (Incorrect secret syntax fixed across all files) ✓
- High: 0/0 (MapReduce env vars subsection was already complete) ✓
- Medium: 0/3 (Best practices, common patterns were already complete) ✓
- Low: 1/1 (Variable interpolation examples already present in index) ✓
