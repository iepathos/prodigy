  "quality_assessment": "Excellent chapter with comprehensive coverage of environment configuration. The chapter is highly accurate with detailed explanations of the two-layer architecture (WorkflowConfig vs EnvironmentConfig), clear examples for all features, and helpful best practices. All technical claims are verified against implementation. No significant drift detected - only minor enhancement opportunities identified.",
  "issues": [],
  "positive_aspects": [
    "Extremely comprehensive coverage of environment configuration features with 700+ lines of documentation",
    "Clear and accurate distinction between user-facing (WorkflowConfig) and internal (EnvironmentConfig) capabilities",
    "Excellent MapReduce-specific environment variable documentation with practical, real-world examples",
    "Accurate documentation that WorkflowStepCommand has no env field (verified at src/config/command.rs:320-401)",
    "Clear explanation that CommandMetadata has env field but WorkflowStepCommand does not (verified at src/config/command.rs:144-145)",
    "Good examples showing both variable interpolation syntaxes ($VAR vs ${VAR}) throughout all phases",
    "Helpful best practices section with security guidance and parameterization patterns",
    "Correct precedence order documentation: shell-level > global env > env_files > parent environment",
    "Realistic and accurate note about profile infrastructure existing but CLI activation not implemented (verified at src/cook/environment/config.rs:33-35)",
    "Well-structured progression from basic concepts to advanced patterns",
    "All secret providers documented match implementation: env, file, vault, aws, custom (verified at src/cook/environment/config.rs:98-112)",
    "Clear documentation of EnvValue types: Static, Dynamic, Conditional (verified at src/cook/environment/config.rs:38-48)",
    "Accurate note that Dynamic and Conditional env values are internal-only, not exposed in WorkflowConfig YAML",
    "StepEnvironment documentation correctly notes it's internal runtime only, not in WorkflowStepCommand (verified at src/cook/environment/config.rs:126-144)",
    "Environment file format and precedence accurately documented with clear examples",
    "Common patterns section provides practical, reusable workflow examples",
    "All code examples are syntactically correct and match current implementation"
