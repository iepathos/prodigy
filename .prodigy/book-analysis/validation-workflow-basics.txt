- Low: 3/3 (content clarifications added)

## Code Validation
- All struct fields verified: ✓ (referenced src/config/command.rs)
- All enum variants verified: ✓
- All examples have real-world sources: ✓ (workflows/implement.yml, workflows/goal-seeking-examples.yml, workflows/debtmap-reduce.yml)
- All referenced files exist: ✓ (verified all 8 internal links)

## Link Fixes Applied
1. ./claude-integration.md → ./workflow-basics/command-types.md
2. ./variables-and-interpolation.md → ./variables/index.md  
3. ./environment-variables.md → ./environment/index.md (2 occurrences)
4. ./merge-workflows.md → ./workflow-basics/merge-workflows.md
5. ./checkpoint-and-resume.md → ./mapreduce/checkpoint-and-resume.md
6. ./mapreduce-overview.md → ./mapreduce/index.md
7. ./output-capture.md → ./variables/custom-variable-capture.md

## Content Improvements Applied
1. Clarified that 'validate' is a field within goal_seek, not a standalone command
2. Updated Command Type Reference table to remove 'validate' as standalone type
3. Added note distinguishing 'capture' vs 'capture_output'
4. Added implementation note about 'do' vs 'do_block' in foreach commands
5. Enhanced link descriptions with context about what readers will find
