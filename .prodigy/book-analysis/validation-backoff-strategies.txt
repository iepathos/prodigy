Status: READY TO COMMIT

## Key Updates
1. Documented all 5 backoff strategies (Fixed, Linear, Exponential, Fibonacci, Custom)
2. Added comprehensive YAML syntax examples for each strategy
3. Explained retry_v2 vs error_policy implementation differences
4. Provided MapReduce integration example with error_policy
5. Documented RetryConfig field interactions (initial_delay, max_delay, jitter)
6. Added best practices table for choosing strategies by scenario
7. Explained timeout interaction (backoff delays count toward agent timeout)
8. Added troubleshooting section for common issues
9. Included source references for every strategy (21 total)
10. Cross-referenced related subsections (5 links)
