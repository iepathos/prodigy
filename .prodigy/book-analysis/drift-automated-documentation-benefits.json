    "Clear, scannable bullet-point format that's easy to read",
    "Uses checkmark emojis (✅) effectively for visual appeal",

    "Includes multi-version support which is a unique capability",
    "Ends with a compelling statement about reusability",

    "Consider adding a brief example or quantification for one of the benefits (e.g., 'Reduced maintenance - 80% less time spent on documentation updates')",
    "Could add a link to 'Real-World Example: Prodigy's Own Documentation' for proof of benefits",
