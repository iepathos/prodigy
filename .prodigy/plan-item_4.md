# Implementation Plan: Add Test Coverage for CheckpointedCoordinator::execute_map_with_checkpoints

## Problem Summary

**Location**: ./src/cook/execution/mapreduce/checkpoint_integration.rs:CheckpointedCoordinator::execute_map_with_checkpoints:215
**Priority Score**: 31.26
**Debt Type**: TestingGap (100% coverage gap)

**Current Metrics**:
- Lines of Code: 51
- Cyclomatic Complexity: 11
- Cognitive Complexity: 48
- Direct Coverage: 0.0%
- Transitive Coverage: 25% (from downstream helpers)

**Uncovered Lines**: 215, 220, 223-224, 228-229, 232-234, 238-239, 242, 244-245, 248, 250, 253-255, 260-261, 263

**Issue**: Complex business logic with complete testing gap. Function orchestrates map phase execution with checkpoint management, batch processing, and result aggregation. Cyclomatic complexity of 11 requires at least 11 test cases for full path coverage.

**Rationale**: Testing before refactoring ensures no regressions. Function currently has 0% direct coverage despite being critical coordination logic. After achieving coverage, the function should be refactored into smaller, testable pure functions.

## Target State

**Expected Impact**:
- Complexity Reduction: 3.3 (from extracting pure functions)
- Coverage Improvement: 50.0% (to reach ~50% coverage)
- Risk Reduction: 13.13

**Success Criteria**:
- [ ] All 22 uncovered lines have test coverage
- [ ] All 11 execution paths are tested
- [ ] All existing tests continue to pass
- [ ] No clippy warnings
- [ ] Proper formatting (cargo fmt)
- [ ] Integration tests cover end-to-end map phase execution
- [ ] Edge cases (empty items, checkpoint triggers, errors) are tested

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Integration Tests for Happy Path

### Phase 5: Final Verification and Coverage Analysis

**Goal**: Verify that all uncovered lines are now tested and analyze the coverage improvement.

**Changes**:
- Run `cargo tarpaulin` to generate coverage report
- Verify all 22 previously uncovered lines are now covered
- Add any missing tests for gaps identified by coverage analysis
- Run full CI suite to ensure no regressions
- Document test coverage improvements in commit message

**Testing**:
```bash
cargo tarpaulin --lib --out Html --output-dir coverage
just ci
cargo test --lib
cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features
```

**Success Criteria**:
- [ ] Coverage for `execute_map_with_checkpoints` reaches ≥90%
- [ ] All 22 previously uncovered lines are now tested
- [ ] All tests pass (unit + integration)
- [ ] No clippy warnings
- [ ] CI checks pass
- [ ] Ready to commit

## Testing Strategy

**For each phase**:
1. Run `cargo test --lib checkpoint_integration::tests` to verify new tests pass
2. Run `cargo test --lib` to ensure no regressions in other tests
3. Run `cargo clippy` to check for warnings
4. Run `cargo fmt` to ensure proper formatting

**Final verification**:
1. `just ci` - Full CI checks
2. `cargo tarpaulin --lib` - Regenerate coverage report
3. Verify coverage improvement from 0% to ≥50%
4. Review uncovered lines to confirm they're either unreachable or tested

## Rollback Plan

If a phase fails:
1. Revert the phase with `git reset --hard HEAD~1`
2. Review the test failures and error messages
3. Adjust the test approach (e.g., use different mocking strategy)
4. Retry the phase with corrections

## Notes

### Testing Approach

This function is complex async orchestration code that coordinates multiple subsystems:
- Checkpoint state management (lines 223-234, 238-239, 260-261)
- Work item processing (lines 228-229)
- Batch processing loop (lines 244-256)
- Checkpoint decision logic (lines 253-255)

**Strategy**:
1. **Integration tests first**: Test the full execution flow to verify orchestration
2. **Focused tests second**: Test specific branches and edge cases
3. **Use existing test patterns**: The codebase already has tests for `get_next_batch`, `process_batch`, etc.
4. **Mock minimally**: Leverage the fact that helper methods (`load_work_items`, `process_batch`) are already testable stubs

### Key Testing Challenges

1. **Async complexity**: Function uses async/await and RwLock guards
   - Solution: Use tokio::test for async test execution
   - Solution: Carefully manage lock acquisition/release in tests

2. **Checkpoint state management**: Function mutates shared checkpoint state
   - Solution: Create test fixtures with pre-initialized checkpoint state
   - Solution: Verify state changes through read locks

3. **Batch processing loop**: While loop with conditional checkpointing
   - Solution: Test with various item counts to trigger different loop iterations
   - Solution: Verify checkpoint saves happen at correct intervals

### Next Steps After This Plan

After achieving test coverage, the next debt item should address the high cognitive complexity (48) by:
1. Extracting pure functions from the coordination logic
2. Separating I/O from business logic
3. Reducing function to simple orchestration of smaller, well-tested functions

This two-phase approach (test first, refactor second) ensures we don't introduce regressions during refactoring.
