# Command Types Documentation Fix Result

## Issue
Drift analysis reported file missing at: docs/workflow-basics/command-types.md
Actual file location (per mkdocs.yml docs_dir): book/src/workflow-basics/command-types.md

## Investigation
The MkDocs configuration specifies:
  docs_dir: book/src

Therefore, the correct path for this section page is:
  book/src/workflow-basics/command-types.md (actual location)
  
NOT:
  docs/workflow-basics/command-types.md (analysis report path)

## Current State
File EXISTS at correct location: book/src/workflow-basics/command-types.md
File size: 433 lines
Content quality: Comprehensive

Coverage analysis:
✓ Claude commands section with examples
✓ Shell commands with output formats documented
✓ Goal-seeking with validation examples
✓ Foreach with parallel execution documented
✓ Write file with format support
✓ Validate command syntax
✓ Common parameters section
✓ Deprecated test command migration guide
✓ 10 real-world workflow examples
✓ Source code references

## Conclusion
No drift fixes required. Documentation is comprehensive and up-to-date.

## Root Cause
The analysis phase (prodigy-debtmap-analyze) generated flattened-items.json 
with incorrect file paths that don't account for mkdocs.yml docs_dir configuration.

Recommendation: Update analysis phase to respect mkdocs.yml docs_dir setting 
when generating file paths.
