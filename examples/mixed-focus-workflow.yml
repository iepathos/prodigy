# Mixed focus workflow
# Shows different focus for different commands

commands:
  - name: mmm-code-review
    focus: architecture
  - mmm-implement-spec
  - name: mmm-code-review
    focus: performance  
  - mmm-implement-spec
  - name: mmm-test-generate
    focus: integration
  - mmm-implement-spec
  - mmm-lint


# This workflow demonstrates:
# 1. Different focus areas in same workflow
# 2. Clean YAML object syntax when needed
# 3. Still dead simple - no complex metadata
