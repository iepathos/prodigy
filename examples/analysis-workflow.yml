# Example workflow demonstrating per-step analysis configuration
# This workflow shows how to optimize analysis runs by specifying
# which commands need fresh analysis data

commands:
  # First command: Implement a spec
  # This uses the initial analysis from workflow start
  - name: mmm-implement-spec
    args: ["$ARG"]
    commit_required: true
    # No analysis configuration - uses initial context
  
  # Second command: Run linting
  # Linting typically doesn't need metrics data
  - name: mmm-lint
    commit_required: false
    # No analysis needed - works with existing code structure
  
  # Third command: Code review
  # This command benefits from both context and metrics
  - name: mmm-code-review
    metadata:
      analysis:
        analysis_types: ["context", "metrics"]  # Run both context and metrics analysis
        max_cache_age: 300                       # Use cache if less than 5 minutes old
        force_refresh: false                     # Don't force if cache is fresh
  
  # Fourth command: Clean up technical debt
  # This needs fresh metrics to prioritize cleanup
  - name: mmm-cleanup-tech-debt
    metadata:
      analysis:
        analysis_types: ["metrics"]   # Only need metrics, not full context
        force_refresh: true           # Always get fresh metrics for accuracy
        max_cache_age: 0              # Ignored when force_refresh is true
  
  # Fifth command: Generate documentation
  # This needs updated context after all changes
  - name: mmm-generate-docs
    metadata:
      analysis:
        analysis_types: ["context"]   # Only need context analysis (default if omitted)
        max_cache_age: 60             # Very short cache - 1 minute
        force_refresh: false          # Use cache if available and fresh

# Usage examples:
# 
# Run with a single spec:
#   mmm cook -p analysis-workflow.yml --args 45
#
# Run with multiple specs:
#   mmm cook -p analysis-workflow.yml --map "specs/*.md"
#
# Skip initial analysis (if commands have their own):
#   mmm cook -p analysis-workflow.yml --skip-analysis
#
# Force metrics for all commands:
#   mmm cook -p analysis-workflow.yml --metrics
