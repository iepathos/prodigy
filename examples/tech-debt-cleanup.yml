# This playbook focuses on technical debt cleanup:
# 1. Analyze technical debt and generate cleanup spec
# 2. Implement the cleanup from generated spec
# 3. Run linting to ensure code quality
#
# The spec generated by mmm-cleanup-tech-debt is automatically
# passed to mmm-implement-spec via variable chaining.
