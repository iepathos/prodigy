# Demo: Focus argument in YAML
# Shows the two ways to specify focus in workflow commands

commands:
  # Method 1: YAML object syntax (Ansible-style)
  - name: mmm-code-review
    focus: technical debt
    
  - name: mmm-implement-spec
    
  - name: mmm-code-review
    focus: test coverage
  
  # Regular command without focus
  - name: mmm-implement-spec
  
  # Another focus example
  - name: mmm-lint

max_iterations: 2

# Both methods work:
# 1. YAML object with focus attribute (cleaner, Ansible-style)
# 2. String format with --focus flag (more CLI-like)
# Choose whichever feels more natural for your workflow!
