[TARGET] TOP 10 RECOMMENDATIONS

#1 SCORE: 10.00 [CRITICAL]
- LOCATION: ./src/init/mod.rs:126 handle_existing_commands()
- ACTION: Extract validate_2_preconditions (confidence: 63%), process_input_pipeline (confidence: 53%), process_input_pipeline (confidence: 54%) to reduce complexity from 9 to ~0
- IMPACT: -4 complexity, -3.5 risk
- COMPLEXITY: cyclomatic=9 (adj:9), branches=9, cognitive=25, nesting=3, entropy=0.60
- DEPENDENCIES: 3 upstream, 4 downstream
   - CALLERS: tests::test_handle_existing_commands_with_conflicts, tests::test_handle_existing_commands_no_tty, run
   - CALLS: UserPrompterImpl::read_line, MockFileSystem::exists, SessionEvent::is_terminal, ... (1 more)
- WHY: Cyclomatic complexity of 9 indicates 9 independent paths requiring 9 test cases minimum - extraction will reduce this to 3-5 tests per function. Function has 3 extractable patterns that can be isolated. These 3 extractions will decompose the function into smaller, focused units that are easier to test and understand. Target complexity per function is 5 or less for optimal maintainability.

#2 SCORE: 10.00 [CRITICAL]
- LOCATION: ./src/config/metadata_parser.rs:93 MetadataParser::extract_description()
- ACTION: Extract nested processing, complex calculations to reduce complexity 7 → ~2

- DEPENDENCIES: 4 upstream, 1 downstream
   - CALLERS: tests::test_extract_description_multiline, MetadataParser::convert_frontmatter_to_definition, MetadataParser::create_minimal_definition, ... (1 more)
   - CALLS: GitDiff::is_empty

   - CALLS: CommandArg::parse, Command::new, GitDiff::is_empty
- WHY: Cyclomatic complexity of 10 indicates 10 independent paths requiring 10 test cases minimum - extraction will reduce this to 3-5 tests per function. Function has 1 extractable patterns that can be isolated. This extraction will create a focused, testable unit. Target complexity per function is 5 or less for optimal maintainability.
