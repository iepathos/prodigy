# /prodigy-fix-book-drift

Update book chapters to fix all detected drift issues and ensure documentation matches the current codebase implementation.

## Variables

- `--project <name>` - Project name (e.g., "Prodigy", "Debtmap")
- `--config <path>` - Path to book configuration JSON (e.g., ".prodigy/book-config.json")

## Execute

### Context

You have completed drift analysis across multiple book chapters. Now aggregate the results, update chapters to fix identified issues, and ensure the book builds successfully.

**Parse Parameters:**
- `--project`: The project name (used in output messages and file paths)
- `--config`: Path to the book configuration JSON file

**Load Configuration:**
Read the configuration file specified by `--config` to get:
- `book_dir`: Book root directory
- `book_src`: Book source directory
- Project-specific paths and settings

### Phase 1: Aggregate Drift Reports

**Determine Analysis Directory:**
Based on the project name from `--project` parameter:
- For Prodigy: `.prodigy/book-analysis/`
- For Debtmap: `.debtmap/book-analysis/`
- Pattern: `.{project_lowercase}/book-analysis/`

Collect all drift reports from map phase:

```bash
ANALYSIS_DIR=".{project_lowercase}/book-analysis"

# Aggregate all chapter drift reports
jq -s '{
  total_chapters: length,
  chapters_with_drift: [.[] | select(.drift_detected == true)] | length,
  total_issues: [.[].issues[]] | length,
  severity_breakdown: (group_by(.severity) | map({(.[0].severity): length}) | add),
  all_reports: .
}' $ANALYSIS_DIR/drift-*.json > $ANALYSIS_DIR/drift-summary.json
```

Check if any drift was detected:
```bash
drift_count=$(jq -r '.chapters_with_drift' $ANALYSIS_DIR/drift-summary.json)
if [ "$drift_count" -eq 0 ]; then
  echo "✓ No book drift detected for $PROJECT_NAME - documentation is up to date!"
  exit 0
else
  echo "⚠ Found drift in $drift_count $PROJECT_NAME chapters"
  jq -r '.all_reports[] | select(.drift_detected == true) | "  - \(.chapter_title): \(.severity) severity, \(.issues | length) issues"' \
    $ANALYSIS_DIR/drift-summary.json
fi
```

### Phase 2: Identify Available Data

1. `{analysis_dir}/drift-summary.json` - Aggregated drift report
2. `{analysis_dir}/drift-{chapter_id}.json` - Individual chapter reports
3. `{analysis_dir}/features.json` - Ground truth feature inventory

### Phase 3: Update Book Chapters

#### Step 1: Review Drift Summary

Read `{analysis_dir}/drift-summary.json` and prioritize:
1. Critical/High severity issues first
2. Medium severity issues next
3. Low severity issues last

#### Step 2: Process Each Chapter with Drift

For each chapter with drift:

#### a. Load Chapter Details
- Read drift report: `{analysis_dir}/drift-{chapter_id}.json`
- Read current chapter: From `chapter_file` in drift report
- Read source code: Use `source_reference` from drift issues
- Read feature inventory: `{analysis_dir}/features.json`

#### b. Analyze Issues
- Review all issues for the chapter
- Group related issues
- Identify fix strategy
- Note positive aspects to preserve

#### c. Apply Fixes by Issue Type

**For Missing Content:**
- Add new section or subsection
- Explain the feature clearly
- Provide practical examples
- Link to related content
- Include use cases

**For Outdated Information:**
- Update to current implementation
- Add deprecation notices if needed
- Show migration path if syntax changed
- Update all affected examples

**For Incorrect Examples:**
- Fix YAML syntax
- Add missing required fields
- Correct field types
- Test example actually works
- Add explanatory comments

**For Incomplete Explanation:**
- Expand explanation with more detail
- Add examples for complex features
- Clarify use cases
- Add diagrams if helpful

**For Missing Best Practices:**
- Add common pattern examples
- Document gotchas and workarounds
- Include optimization tips
- Link to advanced topics

**For Unclear Content:**
- Reorganize for better flow
- Simplify complex explanations
- Add more examples
- Break into smaller sections

#### Step 3: Maintain Book Quality

While fixing drift:

#### Preserve Good Content
- Keep clear, well-written explanations
- Maintain helpful examples that work
- Preserve good structure and flow
- Keep diagrams and illustrations

#### Improve Clarity
- Use consistent terminology across chapters
- Add code comments to complex examples
- Use tables for reference information
- Add cross-references between chapters

#### Update Examples
- Ensure all YAML examples are valid
- Use realistic, practical examples
- Show progression from simple to advanced
- Include expected output where helpful

#### Maintain Book Style
- Follow mdBook conventions
- Use consistent heading levels
- Use consistent code block formatting
- Match tone and voice of existing chapters
- Maintain accessibility and readability

#### Step 4: Verify Changes

After updating each chapter:

#### Check Technical Accuracy
- Examples use correct field names and types
- Struct definitions match source code
- Required vs optional fields accurate
- Default values correct

#### Check Completeness
- All major features covered
- Important use cases shown
- Common pitfalls mentioned
- Best practices included

#### Check Clarity and Flow
- Logical progression of concepts
- Clear explanations
- Examples well-integrated
- Transitions between sections smooth

#### Check Cross-References
- Links to other chapters work
- References are accurate
- Related content is linked
- No broken links

#### Step 5: Update SUMMARY.md if Needed

If you added new chapters or reorganized:
- Update `book/src/SUMMARY.md`
- Ensure chapter ordering makes sense
- Check indentation for sub-chapters
- Verify all files are referenced

#### Step 6: Test Book Build

**Use Book Directory from Configuration:**
Read `book_dir` from the config file loaded earlier.

Verify the book builds successfully:
```bash
cd {book_dir} && mdbook build
```

If build fails, fix errors before proceeding.

#### Step 7: Create Update Summary

Write summary to `{analysis_dir}/updates-applied.md`:

```markdown
