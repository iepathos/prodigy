# /prodigy-add-spec

Generate a new specification document based on a feature description. This command creates a properly formatted specification that follows project conventions and integrates with the existing specification system.

## Variables

DESCRIPTION: $ARGUMENTS (required - natural language description of the feature to implement)

## Execute

### Phase 1: Project Context Analysis

1. **Read Project Context**
   - Read .mmm context files to understand current project state
   - Files read in order: .prodigy/PROJECT.md, .prodigy/ARCHITECTURE.md, .prodigy/CONVENTIONS.md, .prodigy/ROADMAP.md, .prodigy/DECISIONS.md
   - Understand existing capabilities and architectural patterns
   - Identify current technology stack and dependencies

2. **Analyze Existing Specifications**
   - Scan specs/ directory to find existing specification files
   - Parse frontmatter from each spec file to extract metadata
   - Determine next specification number by finding highest existing number + 1
   - Skip SPEC_INDEX.md if it exists (deprecated)
   - Review existing specifications to understand format and depth
   - Identify related specifications and potential dependencies
   - Determine appropriate specification category (foundation, parallel, storage, etc.)

3. **Feature Analysis**
   - Parse the provided DESCRIPTION to extract core requirements
   - Identify functional and non-functional requirements
   - Determine integration points with existing system
   - Assess complexity and implementation scope

### Phase 2: Specification Structure Planning

1. **Determine Specification Details**
   - Generate next specification number (highest existing + 1)
   - Choose descriptive filename: `{number}-{kebab-case-title}.md`
   - Place all specs directly in specs/ directory
   - Determine priority level and category

2. **Requirements Analysis**
   - Break down feature description into specific requirements
   - Identify acceptance criteria and success metrics
   - Determine dependencies on other specifications
   - Identify potential risks and challenges

3. **Technical Design Planning**
   - Analyze architectural implications
   - Identify new modules or components needed
   - Determine data structures and interfaces
   - Plan integration with existing codebase

### Phase 3: Specification Generation

1. **Create Specification Document**
   - Generate complete specification following project template
   - Include comprehensive objective and context
   - Define detailed acceptance criteria with measurable outcomes
   - Specify technical requirements and constraints

2. **Specification Sections**
   - **Header**: Title, number, category, priority
   - **Context**: Background and motivation for the feature
   - **Objective**: Clear statement of what needs to be achieved
   - **Requirements**: Detailed functional and non-functional requirements
   - **Acceptance Criteria**: Specific, testable criteria for completion
   - **Technical Details**: Implementation approach and considerations
   - **Dependencies**: Prerequisites and related specifications
   - **Testing Strategy**: How the feature will be validated
   - **Documentation**: Required documentation updates
   - **Migration**: Any migration or compatibility considerations

3. **Integration Considerations**
   - Define how feature integrates with existing architecture
   - Specify API changes or new interfaces
   - Identify configuration requirements

### Phase 4: Validation and Refinement

1. **Specification Review**
   - Ensure all requirements are clear and testable
   - Verify acceptance criteria are specific and measurable
   - Check for completeness and consistency
   - Validate technical feasibility

2. **Dependency Analysis**
   - Identify prerequisite specifications
   - Check for circular dependencies
   - Determine implementation order constraints
   - Validate integration points

3. **Quality Assurance**
   - Ensure specification follows project conventions
   - Verify proper formatting and structure
   - Check for clarity and unambiguous language
   - Validate technical accuracy

### Phase 5: Context Updates

1. **Update PROJECT.md (if needed)**
   - Add new planned capability to "What Will Exist" section if major feature
   - Update feature list with new specification if significant
   - Adjust project scope if significantly changed
   - Update complexity assessment if needed

### Phase 6: File Organization

1. **Create Specification File**
   - Write specification to specs/{number}-{kebab-case-title}.md
   - Ensure proper file permissions and formatting
   - Validate file structure and content
   - Include YAML frontmatter with metadata at the very beginning of the file

### Phase 7: Commit Changes

1. **Stage All Changes**
   - Stage the new specification file
   - Stage any updated context files (PROJECT.md if modified)

2. **Create Commit**
   - Use descriptive commit message format: "add: spec {NUMBER} - {title}"
   - Include brief description of the specification purpose
   - Reference the specification number in commit message
   - Ensure all related changes are included in single commit

3. **Verify Commit**
   - Check that all modified files are included
   - Verify commit message follows project conventions
   - Ensure no unrelated changes are included
   - Confirm specification file exists with proper frontmatter
