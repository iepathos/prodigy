# Compare Debt Results and Create Commit

## Purpose
Analyze the difference between before and after debtmap results to quantify technical debt improvements made during the MapReduce workflow, then create a git commit documenting these improvements.

## Usage
```
/prodigy-compare-debt-results --before <original-debtmap.json> --after <new-debtmap.json> --map-results '<results>' --successful <count> --failed <count>
```

## Parameters
- `--before`: Path to the original debtmap.json file
- `--after`: Path to the updated debtmap.json file after fixes
- `--map-results`: JSON results from the map phase (optional)
- `--successful`: Number of successfully fixed items
- `--failed`: Number of items that failed to fix

## Process

1. **Load and Parse JSON Files**
   - Read the before and after debtmap.json files
   - Parse the JSON structures

2. **Calculate Overall Metrics**
   - Compare total debt scores
   - Count total items before/after
   - Calculate percentage improvements

3. **Analyze Item-Level Changes**
   - Match items by location (file, function, line)
   - Identify:
     - Items completely resolved (no longer in after)
     - Items with reduced scores
     - Items with increased scores (regression)
     - New items introduced

4. **Category Analysis**
   - Group improvements by debt type:
     - Complexity debt
     - Duplication debt
     - Coverage debt
     - Dependency debt
   - Show which categories improved most

5. **Generate Summary Report**
   Format a concise summary for the commit message:
   ```
   Technical Debt Improvements:
   - Total debt score: 850 ‚Üí 620 (-27%)
   - Items resolved: 8 of 10 targeted
   - Overall items: 45 ‚Üí 37 (-18%)
   
   By category:
   - Complexity: -35% (removed 5 high-complexity functions)
   - Duplication: -42% (eliminated 3 duplicate blocks)
   - Coverage: -15% (added tests for 4 critical functions)
   
   Top improvements:
   1. src/parser.rs::parse_args: score 85 ‚Üí 0 (resolved)
   2. src/auth.rs::validate: score 72 ‚Üí 25 (-65%)
   3. src/utils.rs::process: score 68 ‚Üí 0 (resolved)
   ```

6. **Identify Regressions**
   If any items got worse or new high-score items appeared:
   ```
   ‚ö†Ô∏è Regressions detected:
   - src/main.rs::handle_request: score 45 ‚Üí 52 (+16%)
   - NEW: src/api.rs::send_data: score 38
   ```

7. **Create Git Commit**
   - Stage all changes with `git add -A`
   - Create a commit with the message (explicitly without Claude signature):
   ```
   fix: eliminate <successful> technical debt items via MapReduce
   
   Processed <total> debt items in parallel:
   - Successfully fixed: <successful> items
   - Failed to fix: <failed> items
   
   Technical Debt Improvements:
   [Include the generated debt analysis summary from step 5]
   
   [Include any regressions from step 6 if present]
   
   This commit represents the aggregated work of multiple parallel agents.
   ```
   
   **IMPORTANT**: Do NOT include the Claude signature ("ü§ñ Generated with Claude Code" or "Co-Authored-By: Claude") in this commit message to avoid bloating the commit history.

## Output Format
Generate a concise, markdown-formatted summary suitable for inclusion in a git commit message. Focus on:
- Quantitative improvements (percentages and counts)
- Most significant improvements
- Any regressions or concerns
- Overall success rate

## Error Handling
- If files cannot be read, report the error clearly
- If JSON structure is unexpected, provide details
- Handle cases where items may have moved (line number changes)

## Example Implementation Steps

```python
# Pseudo-code structure
before_data = load_json(before_path)
after_data = load_json(after_path)

# Create lookup maps
before_items = {(item.file, item.function): item for item in before_data.items}
after_items = {(item.file, item.function): item for item in after_data.items}

# Calculate improvements
resolved = before_items.keys() - after_items.keys()
improved = []
regressed = []
new_items = after_items.keys() - before_items.keys()

for key in before_items.keys() & after_items.keys():
    before_score = before_items[key].unified_score.final_score
    after_score = after_items[key].unified_score.final_score
    if after_score < before_score:
        improved.append((key, before_score, after_score))
    elif after_score > before_score:
        regressed.append((key, before_score, after_score))

# Generate summary statistics
total_before = sum(item.unified_score.final_score for item in before_data.items)
total_after = sum(item.unified_score.final_score for item in after_data.items)
improvement_pct = ((total_before - total_after) / total_before) * 100

# Format output
print(f"- Total debt score: {total_before} ‚Üí {total_after} (-{improvement_pct:.0f}%)")
print(f"- Items resolved: {len(resolved)} of {successful + failed} targeted")
# ... continue formatting
```

## Integration Notes
This command is designed to be called from the reduce phase of the MapReduce workflow. It will analyze the debt improvements and automatically create a git commit documenting the results.

The command always creates a commit after analysis to ensure the improvements are properly documented in the git history.
