# /mmm-cleanup-tech-debt

Analyze the Rust codebase for technical debt and perform comprehensive cleanup including code organization improvements, dead code removal, dependency optimization, and structural refactoring. This command systematically identifies and resolves technical debt to improve maintainability, performance, and code quality in Rust projects.

## Variables

SCOPE: $ARGUMENTS (optional - specify scope like "src/agents", "src/mcp", "tests", or "all" for entire codebase)
MMM_CONTEXT_AVAILABLE: Environment variable indicating .mmm context availability
MMM_CONTEXT_DIR: Path to .mmm/context/ directory with analysis data
MMM_FOCUS: Optional focus directive to prioritize specific debt categories

## Execute

### Phase 1: Context-Driven Technical Debt Analysis

1. **Load MMM Context Data (Priority)**
   - Check if `MMM_CONTEXT_AVAILABLE=true` and context directory exists
   - Read `.mmm/context/technical_debt.json` for existing debt analysis
   - Load `.mmm/context/dependency_graph.json` for circular dependencies
   - Parse `.mmm/context/architecture.json` for architectural violations
   - Review `.mmm/context/conventions.json` for style inconsistencies
   - Check `.mmm/metrics/current.json` for quality metrics

2. **Prioritize Using Context Data**
   - **High Priority**: Items from technical_debt.json with impact >= 7
   - **Focus-Driven**: If MMM_FOCUS set, prioritize matching debt categories
   - **Hotspots**: Use complexity_score and change_frequency from hotspots
   - **Critical Coverage**: Address untested_functions from test_coverage.json
   - **Security First**: Prioritize any security-related debt items

### Phase 1b: Supplemental Analysis (if context unavailable)

1. **Code Organization Analysis**
   - Scan for misplaced modules and inconsistent module structure
   - Identify files that should be moved to better locations
   - Check for circular dependencies between crates and modules
   - Analyze module cohesion and coupling
   - Review visibility modifiers (pub, pub(crate), pub(super))

2. **Dead Code Detection**
   - Use `cargo +nightly udeps` to find unused dependencies
   - Run with `#![warn(dead_code)]` to identify unused items
   - Locate unused feature flags and conditional compilation blocks
   - Find orphaned test modules and benchmarks
   - Check for commented-out code blocks

3. **Dependency Audit**
   - Review Cargo.toml for unused dependencies
   - Run `cargo audit` for security vulnerabilities
   - Check for duplicate functionality across crates
   - Identify outdated dependencies with `cargo outdated`
   - Find missing dependencies that should be explicit
   - Review feature flags usage and minimize dependencies

4. **Code Quality Issues**
   - Run `cargo clippy -- -W clippy::all -W clippy::pedantic`
   - Scan for overly complex functions (high cyclomatic complexity)
   - Find functions with too many parameters (>5)
   - Identify large files that should be split into modules
   - Check for inconsistent naming conventions (snake_case, CamelCase)
   - Find excessive use of `unwrap()` and `expect()`

5. **Error Handling Patterns**
   - Find inconsistent error handling approaches (Result vs panic)
   - Identify missing error propagation with `?` operator
   - Check for panic usage that should be Result returns
   - Review custom error types and error conversion implementations
   - Verify proper use of `anyhow` vs custom error types

### Phase 2: Context-Aware Cleanup Strategy Planning

1. **Context-Driven Prioritization**
   - **Critical (from context)**: debt_items with impact >= 8 or effort <= 2
   - **High Priority**: Hotspots with risk_level="High" from technical_debt.json
   - **Focus Alignment**: If MMM_FOCUS set, boost priority of matching categories
   - **Architectural**: violations with severity="High" from architecture.json
   - **Coverage Critical**: untested functions in critical_gaps from test_coverage.json
   - **Dependency Issues**: circular dependencies from dependency_graph.json

2. **Intelligent Cleanup Planning**
   - **From Context**: Use existing debt_items for specific tasks and locations
   - **Duplication Map**: Address items in duplication_map with similarity > 0.9
   - **Complexity Hotspots**: Target files with complexity_score > 20
   - **Convention Violations**: Fix naming_patterns violations from conventions.json
   - **Metrics-Driven**: Address areas with declining trends from metrics/history.json

3. **Risk Assessment**
   - Identify changes that could break existing functionality
   - Plan rollback strategies for risky changes
   - Determine which changes need comprehensive testing
   - Flag changes that require manual review

### Phase 3: Automated Cleanup

1. **Safe Automated Fixes**
   - Run `cargo fmt` to standardize formatting
   - Execute `cargo fix --edition` for edition idioms
   - Apply `cargo clippy --fix` for automatic corrections
   - Remove unused imports with rustfmt
   - Fix simple linting issues automatically

2. **Code Organization**
   - Move misplaced modules to appropriate locations
   - Rename files to follow Rust naming conventions (snake_case)
   - Reorganize module structure following Rust patterns
   - Update mod.rs declarations and use statements
   - Ensure proper module visibility (pub/private)

3. **Dead Code Removal**
   - Remove items marked by `#[warn(dead_code)]`
   - Delete commented-out code blocks
   - Remove empty modules and test files
   - Clean up unused feature-gated code
   - Eliminate redundant trait implementations

4. **Dependency Optimization**
   - Run `cargo update` for compatible updates
   - Remove unused dependencies from Cargo.toml
   - Consolidate duplicate functionality across crates
   - Minimize feature flags to reduce compile time
   - Replace heavy dependencies with lighter alternatives

### Phase 4: Structural Improvements

1. **Function Refactoring**
   - Split large functions into smaller, focused ones
   - Extract common functionality into trait implementations
   - Reduce function parameter counts using builder pattern
   - Convert tuple returns to named structs for clarity
   - Add #[must_use] annotations where appropriate

2. **Module Structure**
   - Reorganize modules for better cohesion
   - Fix circular dependencies between modules
   - Ensure proper separation of concerns (data/logic/IO)
   - Define clear public APIs with minimal surface area
   - Use workspace features for optional functionality

3. **Type System Improvements**
   - Replace stringly-typed APIs with enums
   - Add phantom types for compile-time guarantees
   - Use newtype pattern for domain modeling
   - Implement proper trait bounds on generics
   - Convert runtime checks to compile-time guarantees

4. **Error Handling Standardization**
   - Define custom error types with thiserror
   - Use anyhow for application-level errors
   - Add proper error context with .context()
   - Replace unwrap() with proper error propagation
   - Implement From traits for error conversions

5. **Code Duplication Elimination**
   - Extract common patterns into generic functions
   - Create derive macros for boilerplate code
   - Use trait default implementations
   - Consolidate similar implementations with generics
   - Leverage cargo workspaces for shared code

### Phase 5: Testing and Validation

1. **Pre-cleanup Testing**
   - Run `cargo test --all-features` to establish baseline
   - Execute `cargo test --release` for optimized builds
   - Run `cargo miri test` for undefined behavior detection
   - Execute benchmarks with `cargo bench`
   - Check test coverage with `cargo tarpaulin`

2. **Post-cleanup Validation**
   - Run full test suite after each major change
   - Verify no new unsafe code without justification
   - Use `cargo +nightly build -Z timings` to check build time
   - Validate with `cargo check --all-targets`
   - Run property-based tests if using proptest/quickcheck

3. **Memory and Thread Safety**
   - Run tests under valgrind for memory leaks
   - Use `cargo +nightly miri` for UB detection
   - Check with ThreadSanitizer via `RUSTFLAGS="-Z sanitizer=thread"`
   - Verify no data races with concurrent tests
   - Profile memory usage with heaptrack or similar

### Phase 6: Temporary Specification Generation & Git Commit

**CRITICAL FOR AUTOMATION**: When running in automation mode, generate a temporary specification file containing actionable implementation instructions for the technical debt cleanup, then commit it.

1. **Spec File Creation**
   - Create directory: `specs/` if it doesn't exist
   - Generate filename: `iteration-{timestamp}-tech-debt-cleanup.md`
   - Write comprehensive implementation spec

2. **Spec Content Requirements**
   ```markdown
   # Iteration {N}: Technical Debt Cleanup
   
   ## Overview

   ```

3. **Include Context-Driven Content**
   - Read debt_items from technical_debt.json with actual impact/effort scores
   - Extract hotspots from technical_debt.json with specific complexity metrics
   - Include duplication_map items for code deduplication tasks
   - Reference convention violations from conventions.json with specific fixes
   - Add architecture violations from architecture.json with remediation steps

4. **Actionable Implementation Instructions**
   - Each debt item must have specific, implementable cleanup steps
   - Include exact file paths and line numbers from context data
   - Provide before/after code examples for clarity
   - Include validation commands (cargo check, cargo test, cargo clippy)
   - Reference specific refactoring patterns and techniques

5. **Git Commit (Required for automation)**
   - Stage the created spec file: `git add specs/temp/iteration-{timestamp}-tech-debt-cleanup.md`
   - Commit with message: `cleanup: generate tech debt cleanup spec for iteration-{timestamp}-tech-debt-cleanup`
   - If no significant debt found, do not create spec or commit

## Automation Mode Behavior

**Automation Detection**: The command detects automation mode when:
- Environment variable `MMM_AUTOMATION=true` is set
- Called from within an MMM workflow context

**Git-Native Automation Flow**:
1. Analyze technical debt using MMM context
2. If significant debt found: Create temporary spec file and commit it
3. If no significant debt found: Report "No significant debt found" and exit without creating commits
4. Always provide a brief summary of actions taken

**Output Format in Automation Mode**:
- Minimal console output focusing on key actions
- Clear indication of whether spec was created and committed
- Brief summary of debt items found (if any)
- No JSON output required

**Example Automation Output**:
```
âœ“ Technical debt analysis completed
âœ“ Found 15 high-impact debt items requiring attention
âœ“ Generated spec: iteration-1708123456-tech-debt-cleanup.md
âœ“ Committed: cleanup: generate tech debt cleanup spec for iteration-1708123456-tech-debt-cleanup
```

**Example No Significant Debt Output**:
```
âœ“ Technical debt analysis completed  
âœ“ No significant debt found - codebase is in good shape
```

### Phase 7: Context-Aware Documentation and Reporting

1. **Update Documentation**
   - Update module documentation for moved files
   - Fix outdated rustdoc comments and examples  
   - Update README if crate structure changed
   - Add missing /// or //! documentation comments
   - Generate docs with `cargo doc --no-deps --open`

2. **Context-Enhanced Cleanup Report**
   - **Metrics Comparison**: Before/after metrics using current.json baseline
   - **Debt Reduction**: Items resolved from technical_debt.json with impact scores
   - **Hotspot Improvements**: Changes to complexity_score and risk_level
   - **Coverage Gains**: Improvements to untested_functions and critical_gaps
   - **Convention Compliance**: Fixed violations from conventions.json
   - **Architecture Health**: Resolved violations from architecture.json
   - **Trend Analysis**: Update metrics/history.json with improvements

## Integration with Existing Commands

- Use `/mmm-commit-changes` for individual cleanup commits
- Create specs with `/create-spec` for major refactoring
- Run `/mmm-debug` if issues arise during cleanup
- Use project's Makefile or justfile for validation
- Run `/test` to verify changes don't break functionality

## Quality Standards

The cleanup process must:
- Maintain all existing functionality
- Follow Rust idioms and project conventions
- Leverage Rust's type system for safety
- Not introduce new bugs or regressions
- Pass all clippy lints (with justification for allows)
- Include comprehensive testing and benchmarks
- Provide clear documentation of changes
- Maintain or improve performance characteristics

## Error Handling

- If tests fail: Stop cleanup and report which tests failed
- If build fails: Rollback changes and report compilation errors
- If dependencies conflict: Use cargo tree to analyze and resolve
- If unsafe code detected: Require justification or safe alternative
- If performance regression: Analyze with cargo bench and flamegraph
- If breaking changes needed: Create separate spec for major refactoring
- If miri detects UB: Fix immediately or rollback changes

## Output Format

The command will provide:
1. **Analysis Report**: Summary of technical debt found with severity levels
2. **Cleanup Plan**: Ordered list of changes to be made with risk assessment
3. **Progress Updates**: Real-time updates during cleanup with cargo commands
4. **Performance Metrics**: Before/after comparison of compile time and binary size
5. **Final Summary**: Complete report of changes made with statistics
6. **Recommendations**: Remaining debt and future improvements
