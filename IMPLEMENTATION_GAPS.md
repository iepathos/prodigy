# Prodigy Implementation Gaps Analysis

## Summary
After analyzing the current implementation against the whitepaper specifications, Prodigy has successfully implemented most core features but has several gaps and areas that need attention.

## ✅ Implemented Features

### Core MapReduce Pattern
- **MapReduce executor** (`src/cook/execution/mapreduce.rs`)
- **Setup phase** with command execution and output capture
- **Map phase** with parallel agent execution
- **Reduce phase** for result aggregation
- **JSON input support** with JSONPath extraction
- **Command input support** for file listing

### Parallel Execution & Isolation
- **WorktreePool** (`src/worktree/pool.rs`) for managing parallel worktrees
- **WorktreeManager** (`src/worktree/manager.rs`) for git worktree operations
- **Isolation strategies** with OnDemand, Pooled, Reuse, and Dedicated modes
- **Resource limits** and cleanup policies
- **Automatic worktree creation and cleanup**

### Dead Letter Queue (DLQ)
- **Full DLQ implementation** (`src/cook/execution/dlq.rs`)
- **Failure tracking** with detailed error history
- **Pattern analysis** for common failure types
- **DLQ storage** with persistence to disk
- **Worktree artifacts** preservation for debugging

### Retry Logic
- **Exponential backoff** retry strategy (`src/cook/retry.rs`)
- **Transient error detection** for network/rate limit issues
- **Configurable retry attempts** per task
- **Error classification** (Timeout, CommandFailed, WorktreeError, etc.)

### Progress & State Management
- **EnhancedProgressTracker** for real-time progress monitoring
- **JobStateManager** for checkpoint/resume capability
- **Event logging** with detailed execution history
- **Session state persistence** across restarts

## ❌ Missing or Incomplete Features

### 1. DLQ Reprocessing (Critical Gap)
**Whitepaper Spec**: "Later, reprocess failed items: `prodigy dlq retry workflow-id`"

**Current State**:
- Command exists but returns: "DLQ reprocessing is not yet implemented"
- `DlqReprocessor` struct exists but core logic is incomplete
- No actual retry mechanism for failed items

**Impact**: Failed items cannot be automatically retried, requiring manual intervention

### 2. Job Resumption (Major Gap)
**Whitepaper Spec**: Resume capability for interrupted workflows

**Current State**:
- `prodigy resume-job` command only displays status, doesn't actually resume
- Checkpoint files are created but not used for resumption
- State persistence exists but recovery logic is missing

**Impact**: Long-running workflows cannot recover from interruptions

### 3. Simplified MapReduce Syntax (Minor Gap)
**Whitepaper Spec**: Direct command arrays under `agent_template` and `reduce`

**Current Implementation**: Still uses nested `commands` structure in some places
```yaml
# Whitepaper syntax
agent_template:
  - claude: "/process"

# Current implementation sometimes requires
agent_template:
  commands:
    - claude: "/process"
```

### 4. Filter & Sort Expressions (Partial Implementation)
**Whitepaper Spec**: Filter and sort work items with expressions like `item.score >= 5`

**Current State**:
- Fields exist in configuration
- No actual filtering/sorting logic implemented
- JSONPath extraction works but advanced filtering doesn't

### 5. Error Handling Directives (Incomplete)
**Whitepaper Spec**:
```yaml
on_item_failure: dlq  # Save to DLQ
continue_on_failure: true  # Don't stop entire job
```

**Current State**:
- `on_failure` handlers exist for individual commands
- No workflow-level failure handling configuration
- Missing `continue_on_failure` and `on_item_failure` options

### 6. Variable Interpolation (Limited)
**Whitepaper Spec**: Rich variable system with `${map.results}`, `${map.successful}`, etc.

**Current State**:
- Basic `${item}` interpolation works
- Missing aggregate variables like `${map.successful}`, `${map.total}`
- No cross-phase variable passing

### 7. Workflow Examples & Templates (Missing)
**Whitepaper Spec**: Pre-built templates for common patterns

**Current State**:
- No template system
- No example workflows included
- No `prodigy init` templates for MapReduce patterns

### 8. Performance Metrics (Limited)
**Whitepaper Spec**: Detailed performance tracking and reporting

**Current State**:
- Basic timing information collected
- No aggregated performance reports
- Missing throughput/efficiency metrics

## 🔧 Recommendations for Priority Fixes

### High Priority
1. **Implement DLQ Reprocessing** - Critical for production use
   - Complete `DlqReprocessor::reprocess_items()` logic
   - Add retry workflow generation
   - Test with various failure scenarios

2. **Fix Job Resumption** - Essential for long-running workflows
   - Implement checkpoint recovery logic
   - Add state reconstruction from events
   - Test interruption/recovery scenarios

### Medium Priority
3. **Complete Filter/Sort Logic** - Important for large-scale processing
   - Implement expression evaluator for filters
   - Add sorting mechanism for work items
   - Support complex JSONPath queries

4. **Enhance Variable System** - Needed for complex workflows
   - Add aggregate variables (`${map.total}`, etc.)
   - Implement cross-phase variable passing
   - Document available variables

### Low Priority
5. **Simplify YAML Syntax** - Quality of life improvement
   - Remove nested `commands` requirement
   - Update parser to handle both formats
   - Migrate existing workflows

6. **Add Workflow Templates** - User experience enhancement
   - Create common workflow templates
   - Add to `prodigy init` command
   - Include documentation

## Testing Gaps

1. **Integration tests for DLQ retry scenarios**
2. **Stress tests for parallel execution at scale**
3. **Recovery tests for interrupted MapReduce jobs**
4. **Performance benchmarks for large datasets**
5. **Cross-platform worktree management tests**

## Documentation Gaps

1. **MapReduce best practices guide**
2. **Performance tuning documentation**
3. **Troubleshooting guide for common failures**
4. **API documentation for extending Prodigy**
5. **Migration guide from sequential to MapReduce workflows**
