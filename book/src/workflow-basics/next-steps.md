## Next Steps

Now that you understand basic workflows, explore these topics:

### Within Workflow Basics

Continue learning about workflow fundamentals:

- **[Command Types](command-types.md)** - Learn about all available command types (claude, shell, foreach, validate) and when to use each one

- **[Command-Level Options](command-level-options.md)** - Advanced command configuration including timeout management, output capture, error handling, and conditional execution

- **[Full Workflow Structure](full-workflow-structure.md)** - Complete workflow format with explicit configuration for complex automation pipelines

- **[Environment Configuration](environment-configuration.md)** - Configure environment variables at multiple levels (workflow-wide, step-specific, profiles)

### Advanced Topics

Ready to level up? Explore these advanced features:

- **[Advanced Features](../advanced/index.md)** - Conditional execution, parallel processing with foreach, validation with gap filling, and complex control flow

- **[Environment Configuration](../environment/index.md)** - Comprehensive guide to environment variables, secrets management, profiles, and per-command overrides

- **[Error Handling](error-handling.md)** - Workflow-level and command-level error handling strategies for building resilient automation

- **[MapReduce Workflows](../mapreduce/index.md)** - Massive parallel processing with setup/map/reduce phases for large-scale tasks like codebase transformations

- **[Variable Interpolation](../variables/index.md)** - Capture command outputs, reference work items, access map results, and build dynamic workflows with variables
