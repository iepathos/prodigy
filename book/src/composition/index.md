# Workflow Composition

Prodigy provides powerful composition features that enable building complex workflows from reusable components. This chapter covers importing workflows, using templates, defining parameters, and composing workflows through inheritance.

## Overview

Workflow composition allows you to:
- **Import** shared workflow configurations from other files
- **Extend** base workflows to inherit common configurations
- **Use templates** from a registry for standardized patterns
- **Define parameters** with type validation for flexible workflows
- **Execute sub-workflows** in parallel or sequentially
- **Set defaults** for common parameter values

These features promote code reuse, maintainability, and consistency across your automation workflows.

## Workflow Imports

Import external workflow files to reuse configurations and share common patterns across multiple workflows.
