## Chapters Updated

### Environment Configuration (high severity - 9 issues fixed)
- ✓ **CRITICAL**: Removed entire "Step-Level Environment" section documenting non-existent `env` and `working_dir` fields
- ✓ Added "Per-Command Environment Overrides" section with shell-based alternatives
- ✓ Updated environment precedence list to remove step-level env
- ✓ Fixed precedence example to show correct behavior without step-level overrides
- ✓ Updated best practices section to use shell syntax instead of step-level env
- ✓ Fixed temporary environment changes example to use shell `cd` and inline env vars
- ✓ Added architecture note explaining StepEnvironment is internal-only
- ✓ Clarified that WorkflowStepCommand does not expose env/working_dir fields

### Workflow Basics (high severity - 10 issues fixed)
- ✓ Documented all command types including deprecated `test:` command
- ✓ Added "Command-Level Options" section covering:
  - Basic options (id, commit_required, timeout)
  - Conditional execution (when:)
  - Error handling (on_failure, on_success)
  - Output capture (capture, capture_format)
- ✓ Enhanced merge workflow documentation with:
  - Explanation of when to use merge workflows
  - Correct syntax (commands: wrapper)
  - Comprehensive merge variable documentation
- ✓ Fixed all merge workflow examples to use correct nested structure
- ✓ Added cross-references to detailed chapters

### Command Types (medium severity - 5 issues fixed)
- ✓ Removed non-existent fields from command reference table:
  - `env`, `working_dir`, `handler`, `retry`, `auto_commit`, `commit_config`
  - `step_validate`, `skip_validation`, `validation_timeout`, `ignore_validation_failure`
- ✓ Added note explaining these are internal-only fields not exposed in WorkflowStepCommand YAML
- ✓ Provided alternatives (shell syntax for env/working_dir)
- ✓ Confirmed capture_output deprecation is documented
- ✓ Confirmed retry_original and strategy fields are documented

### Examples (medium severity - 8 issues fixed)
- ✓ Completely rewrote Example 6 (now Example 7) to use correct environment syntax:
  - Removed non-existent `environment:` wrapper
  - Fixed profile structure (flattened env vars, not nested)
  - Added secrets example with proper provider syntax
  - Added shell-based per-command override example
  - Added note about profile activation
- ✓ Added new Example 3: Foreach Iteration showing:
  - Sequential foreach with object items
  - Parallel foreach with error handling
- ✓ Enhanced Example 4 (Parallel Code Review) with output capture example
- ✓ Enhanced Example 5 (Conditional Deployment) with capture_format documentation
- ✓ Fixed all example numbering (1-8)

### MapReduce Workflows (medium severity - 6 issues fixed)
- ✓ Fixed circuit_breaker.timeout to use Duration format ("60s", "1m")
- ✓ Fixed retry backoff initial delay to use Duration format
- ✓ Removed non-existent max_delay field
- ✓ Added note that max_delay is not supported
- ✓ Updated comments to show humantime format examples

## Examples Updated
- 8 YAML examples corrected for syntax accuracy
- 3 new examples added (foreach iteration, output capture)
- All examples now use correct field names and types

## Content Added

### New Sections
- **Per-Command Environment Overrides** (environment.md)
  - Shell-based environment techniques
  - Alternative to non-existent step-level env field

- **Command-Level Options** (workflow-basics.md)
  - Basic options (id, commit_required, timeout)
  - Conditional execution
  - Error handling
  - Output capture

- **Foreach Iteration Example** (examples.md)
  - Sequential and parallel foreach
  - Error handling in foreach

### Enhanced Content
- Environment precedence explanation
- Merge workflow use cases and context
- Architecture notes on internal vs user-facing features
- Comprehensive alternative approaches for missing features

## Deprecation Notices Added
- `test:` command deprecated in favor of `shell:` with `on_failure:`
- `capture_output:` deprecated in favor of `capture:` with variable name
- Step-level `env` and `working_dir` marked as internal-only (not user-facing)

## Technical Accuracy Improvements
- Fixed Duration type serialization (humantime format: "60s", "1m")
- Removed non-existent fields from documentation
- Corrected environment configuration structure
- Updated merge workflow syntax to match implementation
- Fixed profile structure (flattened, not nested)
