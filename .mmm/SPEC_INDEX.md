# Development History

This file tracks the key specifications that shaped the current focused architecture.

## Implemented Core Features

- **13**: `specs/13-prune-learning-feature.md` - Remove over-engineered learning system
- **14**: `specs/14-implement-real-claude-loop.md` - Real Claude CLI integration and self-sufficient loop
- **15**: `specs/15-remove-developer-experience-bloat.md` - Remove premature developer experience features
- **16**: `specs/16-simplify-state-management.md` - Simplify state to essentials only
- **17**: `specs/17-consolidate-core-modules.md` - Consolidate improve module for clarity
- **18**: `specs/18-dynamic-spec-generation-for-improvements.md` - Dynamic spec generation in git
- **19**: `specs/19-git-native-improvement-flow.md` - Git-native improvement architecture

- **23**: `specs/23-command-line-config-option.md` - Add --config flag for custom configuration paths
- **24**: `specs/24-git-worktree-isolation.md` - Git worktree isolation for parallel MMM sessions

## Pending Specifications
- **22**: `specs/22-configurable-iteration-limit.md` - Add --max-iterations flag
- **25**: `specs/25-claude-assisted-worktree-merge.md` - Claude-assisted worktree merge with conflict resolution
- **26**: `specs/26-worktree-cli-flag.md` - Replace worktree environment variable with CLI flag

## Current Focus

The tool now focuses exclusively on:
1. **Dead Simple CLI**: `mmm improve [--target 8.0] [--verbose]`
2. **Real Functionality**: Actually calls Claude CLI and modifies files
3. **Minimal State**: Just tracks what's needed for the loop
4. **Clear Code**: Single module with straightforward logic
5. **Working Loop**: Genuine self-sufficient improvement cycles

## Abandoned Specifications

These were removed to maintain focus on core working functionality:
- **01-02**: Complex project management - Not needed for simple tool
- **03**: API integration - Using direct CLI calls instead
- **04**: Workflow automation - Over-engineered for simple use case
- **05**: Monitoring/dashboards - Not needed for CLI tool
- **06**: Plugin system - Adds unnecessary complexity
- **07**: UX enhancements - Keeping it minimal
- **08**: Complex iterative loops - Simplified to basic improve cycle
- **12**: Complex developer experience - Basic progress feedback sufficient

## Philosophy

Less is more. The tool does one thing well: makes your code better through Claude CLI integration.
