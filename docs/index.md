# Prodigy Documentation

Welcome to the Prodigy documentation. Prodigy is an AI-powered workflow orchestration tool that enables development teams to automate complex tasks using Claude AI through structured YAML workflows.

## What is Prodigy?

Prodigy combines the power of Claude AI with workflow orchestration to:

- **Automate repetitive development tasks** - Code reviews, refactoring, testing
- **Process work in parallel** - MapReduce-style parallel execution across git worktrees
- **Resume long-running operations** - Checkpoint and resume capabilities for workflows
- **Handle failures gracefully** - Dead Letter Queue (DLQ) for automated retry
- **Maintain quality** - Built-in validation, error handling, and retry mechanisms
- **Track changes** - Full git integration with automatic commits
