## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Foundation (Specs 1-2)
- Set up core architecture with SQLite backend
- Implement basic project management
- Create CLI structure with subcommands
- Establish configuration system

### Phase 2: Claude Enhancement (Spec 3)
- Build advanced prompt template system
- Implement context optimization
- Add response parsing and caching
- Create token tracking system

### Phase 3: Automation (Spec 4)
- Develop workflow engine
- Add conditional execution
- Implement parallel processing
- Create checkpoint system

### Phase 4: Intelligence (Spec 5)
- Build monitoring dashboard
- Add analytics engine
- Create reporting system
- Implement alerting

### Phase 5: Extensibility (Spec 6)
- Design plugin API
- Implement plugin loading
- Create plugin marketplace
- Add security sandbox

## Key Design Principles

1. **Progressive Enhancement**: Start simple, add complexity as needed
2. **Plugin-First**: Core features should also use the plugin API
3. **Developer Experience**: Intuitive CLI, helpful errors, great docs
4. **Performance**: Efficient state queries, minimal overhead
5. **Security**: Sandboxed plugins, permission model, secure storage

## Technology Stack

- **Language**: Rust for performance and safety
- **Database**: SQLite for embedded state management
- **CLI**: Clap for argument parsing
- **Async**: Tokio for concurrent operations
- **Web**: Axum for dashboard server
- **Serialization**: Serde for configuration
- **Templates**: Tera for report generation

## Usage Examples

```bash
# Initialize new project
mmm project new my-app --template web-app

# Run development workflow
mmm workflow run development

# Monitor progress
mmm dashboard

# Generate weekly report
mmm report generate weekly-progress

# Install plugin
mmm plugin install github-integration

# Run specific spec with custom command
mmm run --spec authentication --command /implement
```

## File Format

Specification files should be written in Markdown format with clear objectives and acceptance criteria.

Example structure:
```markdown
# Feature: [Feature Name]

## Objective
Brief description of what needs to be implemented.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Criterion 1
- [ ] Criterion 2
- [ ] Criterion 3

## Technical Details
Any specific technical requirements or constraints.
```

## Usage

1. Create a new `.md` file for each feature or task
2. Run `mmm` to process specifications
3. The tool will iterate with Claude CLI to implement the specifications

## Contributing

When adding new specifications:
1. Use the numbered format: `XX-feature-name.md`
2. Include clear acceptance criteria
3. Provide code examples
4. Consider plugin extensibility
5. Update this README with the new spec
