## Specification Numbering

Specifications are numbered sequentially (01, 02, 03...) in order of creation. The number is permanent and never reused, even if a specification is deprecated or removed.

## Adding New Specifications

When adding a new specification:
1. Use the next available number
2. Choose the appropriate category
3. Follow the standard specification template
4. Update this index with the new entry
5. Update ROADMAP.md if needed
