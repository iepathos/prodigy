## Core UX Principles

1. **Instant Gratification**: See progress immediately
2. **Clear Communication**: Always know what's happening
3. **Safe by Default**: Never lose work or break builds
4. **Progressive Disclosure**: Simple for beginners, powerful for experts
5. **Celebration**: Make improvements feel rewarding

## Interactive Features

### 1. Real-time Progress

```rust
pub struct ProgressDisplay {
    spinner: ProgressBar,
    start_time: Instant,
}

impl ProgressDisplay {
    pub fn update(&self, phase: Phase, message: &str) {
        let icon = match phase {
            Phase::Analyzing => "📊",
            Phase::Reviewing => "🔍",
            Phase::Improving => "🔧",
            Phase::Validating => "✅",
        };
        
        self.spinner.set_message(format!("{} {}", icon, message));
    }
    
    pub fn complete(&self, message: &str) {
        let duration = self.start_time.elapsed();
        self.spinner.finish_with_message(
            format!("✓ {} ({})", message, format_duration(duration))
        );
    }
}
```

### 2. Live Preview Mode

```bash
mmm improve --preview

# Shows changes as they're being made
🔧 Improving error handling...

src/auth.rs:42
- let user = get_user().unwrap();
+ let user = get_user()
+     .context("Failed to get user")?;

Accept change? [Y/n/skip all/accept all]: 
```

### 3. Intelligent Interruption

```
🔧 Applying improvements... 

Press Ctrl+C to pause gracefully...
^C

⏸️  Pausing after current file...
✅ Safe to stop. 3 files improved, 2 remaining.

Resume with: mmm improve --resume
```

## Error Handling

### Build Failures

```
❌ Build failed after improvements

The following changes caused compilation errors:
  • src/parser.rs:142 - Type mismatch after refactoring

🔄 Rolling back changes...
✅ Rollback complete. Your code is unchanged.

💡 Try running with --conservative flag for safer improvements
```

### Network Issues

```
⚠️  Claude API unreachable

Would you like to:
  1. Retry (recommended)
  2. Use offline mode (limited improvements)
  3. Cancel

## Smart Suggestions

### Context-Aware Help

```rust
impl SmartHelper {
    pub fn suggest_next_action(&self, session: &Session) -> String {
        match session.last_improvement_type() {
            ImprovementType::ErrorHandling => {
                "Great! Error handling improved. Consider adding tests next:\n  \
                 mmm improve --focus tests"
            }
            ImprovementType::Tests => {

    // Continue...
}
```

```rust
impl IncrementalImprover {
    pub fn improve(&mut self) -> Result<()> {
        // Only analyze changed files
        let changed = self.detect_changes_since_last_run()?;
        
        if changed.is_empty() {
            println!("✨ No changes since last run - your code is still great!");
            return Ok(());
        }
        
        // Focus on changed areas
        self.improve_files(changed)?;
        Ok(())
    }
