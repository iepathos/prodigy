# Iteration 1: Product Enhancements

## Overview
Temporary specification for product enhancements identified from user perspective.

## Enhancement Proposals

### 1. Interactive First-Run Experience
**Impact**: High
**Effort**: Medium
**Category**: UX
**Component**: CLI/onboarding

#### User Story
As a new user, I want a guided first-run experience so that I can quickly understand and start using MMM without reading extensive documentation.

#### Current State
When running `mmm` without arguments, users see a basic help menu. New users must read the README to understand:
- That they need to run `mmm init` first
- What playbook files are and where to find them
- How the tool works conceptually

#### Proposed Enhancement
Add an interactive first-run wizard that detects when MMM hasn't been initialized:
```
$ mmm
👋 Welcome to MMM! It looks like this is your first time.

Would you like to:
1. Quick start - Initialize and run your first improvement loop
2. Learn more - Interactive tutorial
3. Show help - View command reference

Choice [1]: _
```

#### Implementation Approach
- Detect if `.claude/commands` exists in current directory
- If not, prompt for interactive setup
- Guide through `mmm init` and first `mmm cook` command
- Provide contextual help and examples

#### Success Metrics
- Time from installation to first successful cook < 2 minutes
- Reduced support questions about getting started

### 2. Progress Dashboard Command
**Impact**: High
**Effort**: Small
**Category**: Feature
**Component**: CLI

#### User Story
As a developer, I want to see the current status and history of my improvement sessions so that I can track progress and understand what MMM has done.

#### Current State
Progress information is scattered:
- Git history shows commits
- `.mmm/state.json` has basic session info
- No unified view of improvements made

#### Proposed Enhancement
Add `mmm status` command showing:
```
$ mmm status
📊 MMM Project Status

Current Health Score: 73.5/100 ↑ (+5.2 since last week)

Recent Sessions:
  ✅ 2024-01-15 14:23 - Security audit (3 iterations, 12 fixes)
  ✅ 2024-01-14 09:15 - Performance optimization (5 iterations, 8 improvements)
  🔄 2024-01-13 16:42 - Test coverage (paused at iteration 2/10)

Active Worktrees:
  🌳 mmm-performance-1234 (ready to merge)

Quick Actions:
  - Resume paused session: mmm cook --resume session-abc123
  - Merge completed worktree: mmm worktree merge mmm-performance-1234
  - View detailed report: mmm status --detailed
```

#### Implementation Approach
- Parse session history from `.mmm/history/`
- Show health score trends from metrics
- List active worktrees with status
- Provide actionable next steps

#### Success Metrics
- Users check status at least once per week
- Reduced abandoned sessions

### 3. Smart Workflow Recommendations
**Impact**: High
**Effort**: Medium
**Category**: UX
**Component**: CLI/workflows

#### User Story
As a developer, I want MMM to recommend the most appropriate workflow based on my project's current state so that I can maximize improvement impact.

#### Current State
Users must choose from 11 example workflows without guidance on which is most appropriate for their situation.

#### Proposed Enhancement
Add workflow recommendation to `mmm cook` without arguments:
```
$ mmm cook
🔍 Analyzing project state...

Based on your project:
- Test coverage: 45% (low)
- Lint warnings: 127 (high)
- Security issues: 2 critical

Recommended workflows:
1. test-driven.yml - Improve test coverage (biggest impact)
2. security.yml - Fix critical security issues
3. code-review.yml - General quality improvements

Run recommended workflow? [1-3, or path to custom]: _
```

#### Implementation Approach
- Run quick analysis when no playbook specified
- Score different improvement areas
- Recommend top 3 workflows based on need
- Allow direct selection or custom path

#### Success Metrics
- 80% of users accept recommendations
- Improved health score gains per session

### 4. Real-time Progress Visualization
**Impact**: Medium
**Effort**: Medium
**Category**: UX
**Component**: CLI/display

#### User Story
As a developer, I want to see real-time progress during long cooking sessions so that I know the tool is working and how much longer it will take.

#### Current State
Basic spinner messages show current step, but no overall progress or time estimates.

#### Proposed Enhancement
Add rich progress display using a TUI library:
```

- Increased completion rate for long sessions

### 5. Simplified Default Workflow
**Impact**: High
**Effort**: Small
**Category**: UX
**Component**: workflows

#### User Story
As a new user, I want to run MMM without specifying a playbook file so that I can get started immediately without understanding workflow configuration.

#### Current State
Users must specify a playbook file: `mmm cook examples/default.yml`

#### Proposed Enhancement
Make playbook optional with sensible default:
```
$ mmm cook
# Runs built-in balanced workflow

$ mmm cook --focus security
# Runs security-focused workflow

$ mmm cook custom.yml
# Runs custom workflow
```

#### Implementation Approach
- Embed default workflows in binary
- Add `--focus` flag for common scenarios
- Maintain backward compatibility with explicit playbooks

#### Success Metrics
- 50% of cooking sessions use default workflow
- Faster time to first improvement

### 6. Integration with GitHub Actions
**Impact**: Medium
**Effort**: Large
**Category**: Integration
**Component**: CI/CD

#### User Story
As a team lead, I want to run MMM automatically in CI/CD so that code quality improves continuously without manual intervention.

#### Current State
MMM requires interactive Claude CLI authentication and local execution.

#### Proposed Enhancement
Add GitHub Action support:
```yaml
name: MMM Continuous Improvement
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 2 * * 1' # Weekly on Mondays
    
jobs:
  improve:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: mmm-rs/mmm-action@v1
        with:
          claude-api-key: ${{ secrets.CLAUDE_API_KEY }}
          workflow: quality-improvements

**Category**: Feature
**Component**: CLI

#### User Story
As a developer, I want to browse and search through past improvements so that I can understand what changes MMM has made over time.

#### Current State
History exists in git commits and `.mmm/history/` but requires manual inspection.

#### Proposed Enhancement
Add `mmm history` command:
```
$ mmm history

#### Current State
Errors show technical messages but limited actionable guidance.

#### Proposed Enhancement
Add contextual error coaching:
```
❌ Error: Claude command failed

It looks like the mmm-implement-spec command couldn't complete.

Possible causes:
1. The spec file might be malformed
2. Claude CLI might need re-authentication
3. Network connectivity issues
