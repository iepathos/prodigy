# Iteration 1753961463: Technical Debt Cleanup

## Overview
Temporary specification for technical debt cleanup identified from MMM context analysis.

## Debt Items to Address

### 1. Deprecated Comments in debt.rs
**Impact Score**: 8/10
**Effort Score**: 3/10
**Category**: Deprecated
**File**: /Users/glen/memento-mori/mmm/src/context/debt.rs
**Priority**: High

#### Current State:
```rust
// Line 57: DEPRECATED: ...
// Line 179: DEPRECATED: ...  
// Line 180: DEPRECATED: ...
```

#### Required Changes:
- Remove deprecated comments and update the code to use modern patterns
- Ensure deprecated functionality is either removed or properly migrated

#### Implementation Steps:
- Identify what functionality the deprecated comments refer to
- Remove or refactor the deprecated code sections
- Update any dependent code to use new patterns
- Run tests to ensure no regressions

### 2. FIXME Comments Throughout Codebase
**Impact Score**: 7/10
**Effort Score**: 3/10
**Category**: Fixme
**File**: Multiple locations
**Priority**: High

#### Current State:
- Line 55 in debt.rs: FIXME comment
- Line 173-178 in debt.rs: Multiple FIXME comments
- Additional FIXME comments found throughout the codebase

#### Required Changes:
- Address each FIXME comment by implementing the required fix
- Remove the comment once the issue is resolved

#### Implementation Steps:
- Review each FIXME comment to understand the issue
- Implement the necessary fix or refactoring
- Test the changes thoroughly
- Remove the FIXME comment

### 3. Test Function Complexity Hotspots
**Complexity Score**: 13
**Change Frequency**: High
**Risk Level**: Medium
**File**: /Users/glen/memento-mori/mmm/tests/cook_iteration_tests.rs

#### Refactoring Plan:
- Split complex test functions into smaller, focused test cases
- Extract common test setup into helper functions
- Reduce cyclomatic complexity to under 10

### 4. Low Test Coverage
**Current Coverage**: 41.14%
**Target Coverage**: 70%+
**Priority**: Critical

#### Implementation Steps:
- Focus on untested critical paths
- Add unit tests for core functionality
- Increase integration test coverage
- Use cargo tarpaulin to track progress

### 5. Low Documentation Coverage  
**Current Coverage**: 22.65%
**Target Coverage**: 60%+
**Priority**: Medium

#### Implementation Steps:
- Add missing documentation to public APIs
- Document complex functions and modules
- Include usage examples in documentation
- Run `cargo doc` to verify improvements

## Dependency Cleanup

### Outdated Dependencies to Update:
- `axum`: 0.7.9 → 0.8.4
- `directories`: 5.0.1 → 6.0.0
- Other transitive dependency updates

### Implementation Steps:
- Update direct dependencies in Cargo.toml
- Run `cargo update` to update transitive dependencies
- Test thoroughly after updates
- Address any breaking changes

## Code Organization Changes

### Architecture Issues to Address:
1. **Components Missing Interfaces** (abstractions module)
   - Define clear public interfaces for the abstractions module
   - Ensure proper encapsulation and API boundaries

### Module Structure Improvements:
- Review module organization for better cohesion
- Ensure consistent visibility modifiers
- Follow Rust module best practices

## Success Criteria
- [x] All debt items with impact >= 7 addressed
- [ ] Test coverage increased to at least 50%
- [ ] Documentation coverage increased to at least 40%
- [ ] All FIXME and DEPRECATED comments resolved
- [ ] Dependencies updated to latest compatible versions
- [ ] All files compile without warnings
- [ ] Tests pass with same or improved coverage
- [ ] Performance benchmarks maintained or improved
- [ ] Clippy lints resolved or explicitly allowed with justification

## Validation Commands
```bash
cargo fmt --check
cargo clippy -- -W clippy::all
cargo test --all-features
cargo doc --no-deps
cargo outdated
cargo tarpaulin --out Html
```

## Notes
- No circular dependencies found in the dependency graph
- No significant code duplication detected
- Architecture follows modular pattern with clear component boundaries
- Current code follows Rust naming conventions well
