# Specification 72: Enhanced Integrated Help System

**Category**: foundation
**Priority**: high
**Status**: draft
**Dependencies**: None

## Context

Prodigy currently provides basic `--help` flags for commands, but users need more comprehensive in-CLI help with examples, use cases, and detailed explanations. The help system should provide progressive disclosure - simple help for beginners, detailed help for advanced users.

## Objective

Enhance the existing CLI help system to provide comprehensive, context-aware documentation directly within the terminal, including examples, common workflows, and troubleshooting guidance.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- Provide multi-level help: basic (--help), detailed (--help-long), and examples (--examples)
- Display context-aware help based on current directory and project state
- Include inline examples that can be directly copied and executed
- Support help search functionality across all commands
- Show related commands and suggest workflows
- Provide troubleshooting guidance for common errors
- Support interactive help mode with navigation

### Non-Functional Requirements
- Help text must render correctly in terminals with 80+ columns
- Response time for help display must be under 100ms
- Help content must be accessible offline
- Support for colorized and plain text output
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing --help flag

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] All commands have basic, detailed, and example help text
- [ ] Help search returns relevant results in under 100ms
- [ ] Examples include at least 3 common use cases per command
- [ ] Related commands are automatically suggested
- [ ] Help text adapts to terminal width
- [ ] Colorized output enhances readability without being required
- [ ] Interactive help mode allows navigation with arrow keys
- [ ] Help content is extracted from code comments for maintainability
- [ ] Troubleshooting section addresses top 5 user issues per command

## Technical Details

### Implementation Approach
1. Extend clap configuration with custom help templates
2. Create help content registry with structured documentation
3. Implement help search using fuzzy matching
4. Build interactive help browser using crossterm/tui
5. Generate help content from docstrings and attributes

### Architecture Changes
- Add `help` module with content management system
- Extend CLI parser to support new help flags
- Create help template engine for formatting
- Add search index for help content

### Data Structures
```rust
pub struct HelpContent {
    command: String,
    brief: String,
    detailed: String,
    examples: Vec<Example>,
    related: Vec<String>,
    troubleshooting: Vec<TroubleshootingItem>,
}

pub struct Example {
    description: String,
    command: String,
    expected_output: Option<String>,
}
```

### APIs and Interfaces
- `prodigy --help`: Basic help (current)
- `prodigy --help-long`: Detailed help with all options
- `prodigy --examples`: Show examples only
- `prodigy help <command>`: Command-specific help
- `prodigy help --search <term>`: Search help content
- `prodigy help --interactive`: Interactive help browser

## Dependencies

- **Prerequisites**: None
- **Affected Components**: CLI parser, all command modules
- **External Dependencies**:
  - clap (existing)
  - crossterm (for interactive mode)
  - fuzzy-matcher (for search)

## Testing Strategy

- **Unit Tests**: Test help content generation and formatting
- **Integration Tests**: Verify help display for all commands
- **Performance Tests**: Ensure help loads within 100ms
- **User Acceptance**: Test with users of varying experience levels

## Documentation Requirements

- **Code Documentation**: Document help content format and API
- **User Documentation**: Update README with help system usage
- **Architecture Updates**: Document help system architecture

## Implementation Notes

- Use lazy_static for help content to avoid runtime overhead
- Consider generating help content at build time for performance
- Ensure help examples are validated against actual command signatures
- Support NO_COLOR environment variable for plain text output

## Migration and Compatibility

- Existing --help flag continues to work as before
- New help features are additive, no breaking changes
- Help content can be progressively enhanced per command
