# Specification 74: Comprehensive README Documentation

**Category**: foundation
**Priority**: critical
**Status**: draft
**Dependencies**: None

## Context

Prodigy lacks a comprehensive README.md at the repository root, which is the first documentation users encounter. The current CLAUDE.md serves AI context but users need human-focused documentation covering installation, quick start, features, and common workflows.

## Objective

Create and maintain a comprehensive, user-friendly README.md that serves as the primary entry point for new users, providing clear installation instructions, quick start guides, feature overview, and links to detailed documentation.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- Provide clear project description and value proposition
- Include installation instructions for multiple platforms
- Create quick start section with immediate value demonstration
- Document all major features with brief descriptions
- Include animated GIFs or screenshots showing key workflows
- Provide troubleshooting section for common issues
- Link to detailed documentation and resources
- Include contribution guidelines and code of conduct
- Add badges for build status, version, license, downloads
- Maintain table of contents for easy navigation
- Support multiple installation methods (cargo, brew, apt, etc.)

### Non-Functional Requirements
- README must render correctly on GitHub, GitLab, and local viewers
- Keep README under 500 lines for readability
- Support both light and dark themes for images/GIFs
- Maintain consistency with crates.io description
- Optimize images/GIFs for fast loading
- Ensure examples are copy-paste ready

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] README includes all standard sections (description, installation, usage, features, etc.)
- [ ] Installation instructions cover macOS, Linux, and Windows
- [ ] Quick start gets users to first success in under 5 minutes
- [ ] At least 3 workflow examples with explanations
- [ ] All code examples are tested and working
- [ ] Images/GIFs demonstrate key features
- [ ] Troubleshooting covers top 10 user issues
- [ ] Links to all related documentation are included
- [ ] README passes markdownlint without errors
- [ ] Table of contents auto-updates with sections

## Technical Details

### Implementation Approach
1. Create structured README template
2. Extract feature list from codebase analysis
3. Generate installation scripts for testing
4. Create demo workflows for quick start
5. Record GIFs/screenshots of key features
6. Set up automated README validation

### README Structure
```markdown
# Prodigy ðŸš€

[Badges: CI, Version, License, Downloads]

> One-line description of Prodigy's value

## Table of Contents

## Features
- Feature highlights with emoji indicators
- Brief description of each major capability

## Installation

### Using Cargo (Recommended)
### Using Homebrew (macOS/Linux)
### Using Package Managers
### From Source

## Quick Start

### Your First Workflow
### Parallel Execution Example
### Goal-Seeking Example

## Usage

### Basic Commands
### Advanced Workflows
### Configuration

## Examples

### Example 1: Automated Testing Pipeline
### Example 2: Parallel Code Analysis
### Example 3: Goal-Seeking Optimization

## Documentation

- [User Guide](docs/user-guide.md)
- [API Reference](docs/api.md)
- [Workflow Syntax](docs/workflows.md)
- [Architecture](ARCHITECTURE.md)

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

## Acknowledgments
```

### APIs and Interfaces
- README.md serves as documentation interface
- Links to all other documentation resources
- Copy-paste ready examples
- Quick reference for commands

## Dependencies

- **Prerequisites**: None
- **Affected Components**: Repository root, documentation
- **External Dependencies**:
  - markdownlint (for validation)
  - vhs or asciinema (for terminal recordings)
  - GitHub markdown renderer (for preview)

## Testing Strategy

- **Validation Tests**: Ensure all links work
- **Example Tests**: Verify all code examples execute
- **Installation Tests**: Test installation instructions on all platforms
- **User Acceptance**: Test with new users unfamiliar with project

## Documentation Requirements

- **Code Documentation**: Link from Cargo.toml
- **User Documentation**: Serves as primary user documentation
- **Architecture Updates**: Link to ARCHITECTURE.md

## Implementation Notes

- Keep examples simple but meaningful
- Use collapsible sections for detailed content
- Include emoji sparingly for visual hierarchy
- Test all installation methods in CI
- Generate some sections from code to maintain sync
- Consider README translations for international users

## Migration and Compatibility

- No breaking changes
- Preserves existing CLAUDE.md for AI context
- Links to all existing documentation
- Maintains backward compatibility with existing docs references
