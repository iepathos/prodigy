# Specification 115: Fix Checkpoints Verbose Flag Type Conflict

**Category**: compatibility
**Priority**: critical
**Status**: draft
**Dependencies**: None

## Context

The `prodigy checkpoints` command currently fails with a type mismatch error when parsing command-line arguments. This is caused by a conflict between the global `verbose` flag (defined as `u8` for counting occurrences) and the local `verbose` flag in the `CheckpointCommands::List` subcommand (defined as `bool`).

The error manifests as:
```
thread 'main' panicked at src/cli/args.rs:17:18:
Mismatch between definition and access of `verbose`. Could not downcast to u8, need to downcast to bool
```

This prevents users from listing, managing, or resuming checkpoints, which is critical functionality for workflow recovery and session management.

## Objective

Fix the type conflict between global and local verbose flags in the checkpoints command, ensuring all checkpoint subcommands work correctly while maintaining consistent verbosity behavior across the application.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- Checkpoint commands must parse arguments without panicking
- Global verbosity levels must be respected across all subcommands
- Local verbose flags in subcommands must not conflict with global flags
- All checkpoint subcommands must function correctly:
  - list/ls - List available checkpoints
  - clean - Delete old checkpoints
  - show - Display checkpoint details
  - validate - Check checkpoint integrity
  - mapreduce - List MapReduce checkpoints
  - delete - Remove specific checkpoints

### Non-Functional Requirements
- No breaking changes to existing command-line interface
- Consistent verbosity behavior across all commands
- Clear separation between global and local flags
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing scripts

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] `prodigy checkpoints list` executes without panic
- [ ] `prodigy checkpoints list -v` shows verbose output
- [ ] Global verbosity flags (`-v`, `-vv`, `-vvv`) work with checkpoint commands
- [ ] All checkpoint subcommands execute successfully
- [ ] Verbose output properly shows additional detail when requested
- [ ] No regression in other commands that use verbose flags
- [ ] Unit tests pass for argument parsing
- [ ] Integration tests verify all checkpoint commands work

## Technical Details

### Implementation Approach

1. **Remove Conflicting Local Verbose Flags**
   - Remove the `verbose: bool` field from `CheckpointCommands::List` (line 343)
   - Remove similar conflicts from other subcommands if present
   - Rely on the global `verbose: u8` flag for all verbosity control

2. **Update Command Handlers**
   - Modify checkpoint command handlers to use the global verbose value
   - Pass verbosity level through command context
   - Adjust output detail based on verbosity level (0, 1, 2, 3+)

3. **Alternative: Rename Local Flags**
   - If local verbose behavior is different from global:
     - Rename to `detailed: bool` or `show_details: bool`
     - Update command documentation accordingly
     - Maintain semantic clarity about the flag's purpose

### Architecture Changes

The fix involves minimal architecture changes:
- Argument parsing structure in `src/cli/args.rs`
- Command handler functions that consume the verbose flag
- Output formatting based on verbosity level

### Data Structures

No new data structures required. The change involves:
- Removing or renaming the `verbose` field in checkpoint subcommands
- Using the existing global `verbose: u8` field

### APIs and Interfaces

Command-line interface remains largely unchanged:
- Global: `-v`, `-vv`, `-vvv` for increasing verbosity
- Local: Remove or rename conflicting verbose flags
- Ensure help text accurately reflects available options

## Dependencies

- **Prerequisites**: None
- **Affected Components**:
  - `src/cli/args.rs` - Argument definitions
  - `src/cli/handlers/checkpoints.rs` - Command handlers
  - Any code that processes checkpoint command arguments
- **External Dependencies**: clap crate (already present)

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- Test argument parsing for all checkpoint subcommands
- Verify no panic occurs with various flag combinations
- Test verbosity level propagation

### Integration Tests
- Execute all checkpoint commands with different verbosity levels
- Verify output detail increases with verbosity
- Test interaction with actual checkpoint files

### Manual Testing
- Run `prodigy checkpoints list` with various flags
- Verify verbose output shows expected additional information
- Test all checkpoint subcommands for proper execution

### Regression Testing
- Ensure other commands with verbose flags still work
- Verify global verbosity affects all commands consistently
- Check that existing scripts continue to function

## Documentation Requirements

### Code Documentation
- Update inline documentation for removed/renamed flags
- Document verbosity level behavior (0-3+)
- Add comments explaining the global/local flag strategy

### User Documentation
- Update command help text to reflect changes
- Document verbosity levels and their effects
- Provide examples of proper usage

### Architecture Updates
- Note the decision to use global verbose flags exclusively
- Document the verbosity level convention across the application

## Implementation Notes

### Immediate Fix Priority
This is a critical bug that prevents checkpoint functionality from working. The fix should be prioritized and can be implemented quickly.

### Verbosity Level Convention
- 0 (default): Normal output
- 1 (-v): Debug-level information
- 2 (-vv): Trace-level information
- 3+ (-vvv): All available information

### Backward Compatibility
If the local `verbose` flag was documented or used in scripts, consider:
- Adding a deprecation warning before removal
- Supporting both flags temporarily with clear migration path
- Documenting the change in release notes

## Migration and Compatibility

### Breaking Changes
- Removal of `--verbose` flag from `checkpoints list` subcommand
- Possible changes to output format based on global verbosity

### Migration Path
1. Users should use global `-v` flags instead of local `--verbose`
2. Scripts should be updated to use global verbosity flags
3. Consider adding alias or compatibility shim if needed

### Compatibility Testing
- Test with existing workflow files
- Verify checkpoint recovery still functions
- Ensure MapReduce checkpoints are unaffected
