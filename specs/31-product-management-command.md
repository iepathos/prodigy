# Specification 31: Product Management Command

**Category**: optimization
**Priority**: medium
**Status**: draft
**Dependencies**: [14, 19, 21, 28]

## Context

The project currently has `/mmm-code-review` which focuses on code quality, best practices, error handling, and technical improvements. While this is valuable for maintaining code health, there's a gap in product-focused improvements that enhance user experience, features, and overall product value.

Product managers think differently than code reviewers - they focus on user value, feature completeness, usability, and solving real user problems rather than technical perfection. This specification introduces a new command that brings this product management perspective to the automated improvement process.

## Objective

Create a new `/mmm-product-enhance` command that analyzes code from a product management perspective, focusing on feature improvements, user experience enhancements, and value-driven development rather than code quality metrics.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- Command name: `/mmm-product-enhance` (follows existing convention)
- Accepts optional focus parameter like other commands
- Generates improvement specs in `specs/temp/` directory
- Commits specs with format: `product: enhance {feature} for iteration-{timestamp}`
- Integrates seamlessly with existing workflow system
- Works with configurable workflows via `.mmm/config.toml`

### Non-Functional Requirements
- Maintains the same performance characteristics as `/mmm-code-review`
- Uses existing Claude CLI integration patterns
- Follows git-native improvement flow
- Respects MMM_AUTOMATION environment variable

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] `/mmm-product-enhance` command is available in Claude CLI
- [ ] Command analyzes code for product/feature opportunities
- [ ] Focus areas include: user experience, feature completeness, API design, documentation, onboarding
- [ ] Generates actionable improvement specs focused on user value
- [ ] Specs prioritize features over refactoring
- [ ] Command can be used in custom workflows
- [ ] Works with focus parameter (e.g., "onboarding", "api", "cli-ux")
- [ ] Complements rather than duplicates `/mmm-code-review`
- [ ] Integration tests verify command behavior

## Technical Details

### Implementation Approach
1. Create new Claude command definition following existing patterns
2. Design prompt to emphasize product management perspective
3. Focus on user stories and feature enhancements
4. Generate specs that describe feature additions/improvements
5. Ensure compatibility with existing spec implementation flow

### Architecture Changes
- Add `/mmm-product-enhance` to available commands
- No changes to core architecture required
- Leverages existing git-native flow

### Data Structures
No new data structures required - uses existing spec format.

### APIs and Interfaces
```
# Command usage
claude /mmm-product-enhance [--focus "area"]

# Environment variables
MMM_FOCUS - Optional focus area (e.g., "api", "cli", "docs")
MMM_AUTOMATION - Automation mode flag
```

## Dependencies

- **Prerequisites**: 
  - Spec 14: Real Claude Loop (for Claude CLI integration)
  - Spec 19: Git-Native Flow (for spec generation/commit)
  - Spec 21: Configurable Workflow (for workflow integration)
  - Spec 28: Structured Commands (for command registry)
- **Affected Components**: 
  - Claude command registry
  - Workflow configuration examples
- **External Dependencies**: None

## Testing Strategy

- **Unit Tests**: Not applicable (Claude command)
- **Integration Tests**: 
  - Test command execution via `mmm improve`
  - Verify spec generation format
  - Test focus parameter handling
  - Validate workflow integration
- **Performance Tests**: Ensure similar performance to `/mmm-code-review`
- **User Acceptance**: 
  - Command generates valuable product improvements
  - Specs are actionable and user-focused
  - Clear differentiation from code review

## Documentation Requirements

- **Code Documentation**: Command definition in Claude
- **User Documentation**: 
  - Add to command reference
  - Include in workflow examples
  - Explain product vs code focus
- **Architecture Updates**: None required

## Implementation Notes

### Product Focus Areas
1. **User Experience**: CLI usability, error messages, help text
2. **Feature Completeness**: Missing features, partial implementations
3. **API Design**: Developer experience, consistency, documentation
4. **Onboarding**: First-run experience, tutorials, examples
5. **Integration**: Third-party tool support, ecosystem fit
6. **Performance**: User-perceived performance, responsiveness
7. **Documentation**: User guides, API docs, examples

### Differentiation from Code Review
- `/mmm-code-review`: "This error handling could be more robust"
- `/mmm-product-enhance`: "Users would benefit from a --dry-run flag"

- `/mmm-code-review`: "Extract this into a separate function"
- `/mmm-product-enhance`: "Add progress indicators for long operations"

- `/mmm-code-review`: "Use more idiomatic Rust patterns"
- `/mmm-product-enhance`: "Support JSON output for CI integration"

## Migration and Compatibility

No migration required. The command is additive and doesn't affect existing functionality. Users can choose to use it in custom workflows or stick with the default code review focused workflow.
