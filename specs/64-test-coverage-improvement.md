# Specification 64: Test Coverage Improvement to 80%

**Category**: testing
**Priority**: high
**Status**: draft
**Dependencies**: None

## Context

The current test coverage for the prodigy codebase is at 60.8% (15,904/26,138 lines). To ensure code quality and reliability, we need to increase coverage to at least 80%, requiring approximately 5,000 additional lines to be covered. Analysis has identified several critical modules with low or zero coverage that would significantly improve overall test coverage when addressed.

## Objective

Increase code coverage from 60.8% to 80%+ by adding comprehensive tests for the five highest-impact modules, focusing on critical execution paths, error handling, and edge cases.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- Add comprehensive test suites for MapReduce execution module
- Create tests for Workflow Executor complex scenarios
- Implement CLI integration tests for all commands
- Add tests for input handling and data processing modules
- Create tests for progress tracking and display functionality
- Ensure all new tests are maintainable and follow project conventions

### Non-Functional Requirements
- Tests must execute quickly (< 5 seconds for unit tests, < 30 seconds for integration tests)
- Tests must be deterministic and not rely on external services
- Tests must use existing testing infrastructure (cargo test, tarpaulin)
- Coverage measurement must be automated in CI/CD pipeline

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Overall test coverage reaches 80% or higher as measured by cargo tarpaulin
- [ ] MapReduce module coverage increases from 25.8% to 70%+
- [ ] Workflow Executor coverage increases from 24.7% to 70%+
- [ ] Main/CLI module coverage increases from 8.4% to 60%+
- [ ] All previously untested input modules have at least 50% coverage
- [ ] All previously untested progress modules have at least 50% coverage
- [ ] All tests pass consistently in CI environment
- [ ] No existing tests are broken or removed

## Technical Details

### Implementation Approach

#### Phase 1: MapReduce Module Testing (Priority 1)
**Current**: 25.8% covered (429/1662 lines)
**Target**: 70%+ coverage
**Impact**: +1,233 uncovered lines (~4.7% overall increase)

Key areas to test:
- Agent lifecycle management (spawn, monitor, cleanup)
- Work item distribution and load balancing
- Error handling and retry logic
- DLQ (Dead Letter Queue) operations
- State persistence and recovery
- Progress tracking and reporting
- Resource limits and throttling
- Interruption handling

Test strategies:
- Mock WorktreeManager for isolated testing
- Simulate various failure scenarios
- Test concurrent execution with race conditions
- Verify checkpoint/resume functionality

#### Phase 2: Workflow Executor Testing (Priority 2)
**Current**: 24.7% covered (359/1453 lines)
**Target**: 70%+ coverage
**Impact**: +1,094 uncovered lines (~4.2% overall increase)

Key areas to test:
- Command execution for all types (claude, shell, test, goal_seek, foreach)
- Variable interpolation and capture
- Error handling and on_failure strategies
- Conditional execution (if/when clauses)
- Loop constructs and iteration
- Timeout handling
- Git commit verification
- Session management integration

Test strategies:
- Mock command executors for deterministic testing
- Test complex workflow compositions
- Verify state transitions and error propagation
- Test edge cases in variable substitution

#### Phase 3: CLI/Main Module Testing (Priority 3)
**Current**: 8.4% covered (64/762 lines)
**Target**: 60%+ coverage
**Impact**: +698 uncovered lines (~2.7% overall increase)

Key areas to test:
- All CLI commands (cook, exec, batch, resume, worktree, init, events, dlq)
- Argument parsing and validation
- Configuration loading and merging
- Error reporting and user feedback
- Signal handling (SIGINT, SIGTERM)
- Verbose output levels
- File path resolution

Test strategies:
- Integration tests using actual CLI invocations
- Test various argument combinations
- Verify error messages and exit codes
- Mock file system operations where needed

#### Phase 4: Input Module Testing (Priority 4)
**Current**: 0% covered (713 lines total across multiple files)
**Target**: 50%+ coverage
**Impact**: +356 lines (~1.4% overall increase)

Modules to test:
- standard_input.rs: stdin reading and parsing
- structured_data.rs: JSON/YAML/TOML processing
- generated.rs: Dynamic input generation
- file_pattern.rs: Glob pattern matching
- arguments.rs: Argument parsing and validation
- environment.rs: Environment variable handling

Test strategies:
- Mock stdin for testing standard input
- Test various data format parsers
- Verify error handling for malformed input
- Test pattern matching edge cases

#### Phase 5: Progress Module Testing (Priority 5)
**Current**: 0% covered (335 lines total)
**Target**: 50%+ coverage
**Impact**: +168 lines (~0.6% overall increase)

Modules to test:
- progress_tracker.rs: Progress state management
- progress_display.rs: Terminal UI rendering
- progress_dashboard.rs: Dashboard visualization
- Event streaming and real-time updates

Test strategies:
- Mock terminal output for display testing
- Test progress state transitions
- Verify concurrent update handling
- Test various display modes

### Architecture Changes

No architectural changes required. All testing will use existing infrastructure:
- Existing test framework (cargo test)
- Current mocking patterns in codebase
- Established test organization structure

### Data Structures

Test fixtures and mocks needed:
```rust
// Mock structures for testing
struct MockWorktreeManager { /* ... */ }
struct MockCommandExecutor { /* ... */ }
struct MockInputProvider { /* ... */ }
struct MockProgressDisplay { /* ... */ }
```

### APIs and Interfaces

No new APIs required. Tests will validate existing interfaces.

## Dependencies

- **Prerequisites**: None
- **Affected Components**: All modules being tested
- **External Dependencies**:
  - cargo-tarpaulin for coverage measurement
  - Standard Rust testing framework

## Testing Strategy

- **Unit Tests**: Focus on individual functions and methods
- **Integration Tests**: Test module interactions and workflows
- **Performance Tests**: Ensure tests complete within time limits
- **Coverage Validation**: Automated measurement via cargo tarpaulin

## Documentation Requirements

- **Code Documentation**: Document all test utilities and helpers
- **Test Documentation**: Clear test names describing scenarios
- **Coverage Reports**: Generate and publish coverage reports
- **Testing Guide**: Update CONTRIBUTING.md with testing guidelines

## Implementation Notes

### Best Practices
- Use descriptive test names following pattern: `test_module_scenario_expected_outcome`
- Keep tests focused on single behaviors
- Use test fixtures to reduce duplication
- Prefer integration tests for complex workflows
- Mock external dependencies consistently

### Common Testing Patterns
```rust
// Standard test structure
#[test]
fn test_feature_scenario() {
    // Arrange
    let mut fixture = TestFixture::new();

    // Act
    let result = fixture.execute_action();

    // Assert
    assert_eq!(result, expected_value);
}

// Async test pattern
#[tokio::test]
async fn test_async_operation() {
    // Test async code
}

// Property-based testing for edge cases
#[quickcheck]
fn prop_invariant_holds(input: TestInput) -> bool {
    // Verify property
}
```

### Coverage Measurement
```bash
# Run coverage locally
cargo tarpaulin --out Lcov --output-dir target/coverage

# Generate HTML report
cargo tarpaulin --out Html

# Check coverage threshold
cargo tarpaulin --print-summary --fail-under 80
```

## Migration and Compatibility

- No breaking changes to existing code
- All new tests are additive
- Existing tests remain unchanged
- Coverage improvements are backwards compatible

## Success Metrics

- Coverage increases to 80%+ within implementation period
- All new tests pass consistently
- No regression in existing test suite
- Test execution time remains reasonable (< 2 minutes total)
- Coverage report integrated into CI pipeline
