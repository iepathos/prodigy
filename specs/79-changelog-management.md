# Specification 79: Changelog Management

**Category**: foundation
**Priority**: high
**Status**: draft
**Dependencies**: None

## Context

Users and maintainers need visibility into changes between versions. Prodigy lacks a structured CHANGELOG.md tracking features, fixes, and breaking changes. Automated changelog generation ensures consistency and reduces maintenance burden while keeping users informed.

## Objective

Implement comprehensive changelog management system with automated generation from git commits, semantic versioning support, and multiple output formats, maintaining a human-readable CHANGELOG.md that tracks all notable changes.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- Maintain CHANGELOG.md following Keep a Changelog format
- Auto-generate changelog from conventional commits
- Support semantic versioning (major.minor.patch)
- Categorize changes (Added, Changed, Deprecated, Removed, Fixed, Security)
- Include breaking changes section
- Generate release notes for GitHub releases
- Support unreleased changes section
- Link to commits and pull requests
- Include contributor attribution
- Generate migration guides for breaking changes
- Support multiple output formats (Markdown, JSON, HTML)
- Provide changelog validation and linting

### Non-Functional Requirements
- Changelog generation completes in under 5 seconds
- Maintains consistent formatting across updates
- Preserves manual edits when regenerating
- Works with existing git history
- Supports monorepo configurations
- Integrates with CI/CD pipeline

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] CHANGELOG.md exists following Keep a Changelog format
- [ ] Conventional commits automatically populate changelog
- [ ] Each release has dedicated section with date
- [ ] Breaking changes prominently displayed
- [ ] All change types properly categorized
- [ ] Links to commits and PRs functional
- [ ] Unreleased section tracks pending changes
- [ ] Release notes generated for GitHub/GitLab
- [ ] Migration guides generated for breaking changes
- [ ] Changelog validates without errors

## Technical Details

### Implementation Approach
1. Create initial CHANGELOG.md from git history
2. Implement conventional commit parsing
3. Build changelog generation tool
4. Integrate with release process
5. Add validation and linting

### Changelog Format
```markdown
# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## Dependencies

- **Prerequisites**: Git repository with commit history
- **Affected Components**: Release process, CI/CD
- **External Dependencies**:
  - git-cliff or conventional-changelog
  - semver crate
  - regex for commit parsing

## Testing Strategy

- **Unit Tests**: Test commit parsing and categorization
- **Integration Tests**: Test changelog generation from real repos
- **Validation Tests**: Ensure format compliance
- **User Acceptance**: Review generated changelogs with users

## Documentation Requirements

- **Code Documentation**: Document changelog generation process
- **User Documentation**: Add changelog info to contributing guide
- **Architecture Updates**: Document commit conventions

## Implementation Notes

- Use git-cliff for Rust-native solution
- Parse existing commits to bootstrap changelog
- Support custom commit types via configuration
- Generate changelog on every commit in CI
- Consider using commit hooks for validation
- Keep manual edits in separate sections
- Support changelog fragments for PRs

## Migration and Compatibility

- Generate initial changelog from existing history
- No breaking changes to existing workflows
