# Specification 106: Optimize Memory Allocation Patterns

## Context

The codebase shows excessive memory allocations with 1,800 `.clone()` calls, 4,746 `.to_string()` calls, and 396 `Vec::new()` calls without capacity hints. This creates unnecessary memory pressure and allocation overhead, potentially affecting performance in MapReduce scenarios with large datasets.

Performance impact areas:
- MapReduce hot paths with unnecessary clones
- String allocations in logging and error handling
- Vector reallocations during data processing
- Memory pressure during parallel execution

## Objective

Optimize memory allocation patterns throughout the codebase by reducing unnecessary clones, using borrowing where possible, and implementing zero-copy patterns where appropriate, while maintaining code clarity and safety.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- Reduce clone() usage in hot paths by 60%
- Replace to_string() with borrowing where possible
- Add capacity hints to Vec allocations where size is predictable
- Implement Copy trait for small, frequently cloned types
- Use Cow<str> for conditional string ownership
- Maintain all current functionality and safety guarantees

### Non-Functional Requirements
- Measurable reduction in memory allocation overhead
- No performance regression in single-threaded scenarios
- Improved performance in parallel MapReduce execution
- Maintain code readability and safety
- Binary size should remain under 20MB target

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Clone usage reduced by 60% in MapReduce hot paths
- [ ] Vec::with_capacity used in 80% of predictable size cases
- [ ] Copy trait implemented for appropriate small types
- [ ] String allocations reduced by 40% in non-user-facing code
- [ ] Memory usage benchmarks show improvement
- [ ] All tests pass with optimization changes
- [ ] Performance benchmarks show no regression
- [ ] Code review confirms readability maintained

## Technical Details

### Implementation Approach

1. **Phase 1: Hot Path Analysis**
   - Profile MapReduce execution to identify allocation hotspots
   - Analyze clone usage patterns in critical paths
   - Identify opportunities for borrowing vs ownership

2. **Phase 2: Strategic Optimizations**
   - Replace clones with references in read-only scenarios
   - Implement Copy for small types (IDs, flags, simple enums)
   - Add Vec capacity hints where collection size is known

3. **Phase 3: Advanced Patterns**
   - Use Cow<str> for conditional string ownership
   - Implement zero-copy deserialization where possible
   - Optimize string handling in logging and error paths

### Optimization Patterns

```rust
// Before: Excessive cloning in MapReduce
async fn process_item(item: WorkItem, state: Arc<Mutex<State>>) -> Result<Output> {
    let item_clone = item.clone();  // Unnecessary
    let state_clone = state.clone(); // Arc clone is cheap but still overhead
    // ... processing
}

// After: Borrowing and efficient sharing
async fn process_item(item: &WorkItem, state: &Arc<Mutex<State>>) -> Result<Output> {
    // Use references where possible
    // Arc clone only when needed for async boundaries
}

// Before: String allocations
fn format_error(error: &Error) -> String {
    format!("Error: {}", error.to_string())
}

// After: Borrowing with Cow
fn format_error(error: &Error) -> Cow<'_, str> {
    match error.kind() {
        ErrorKind::Simple => error.message().into(), // Borrow
        ErrorKind::Complex => format!("Error: {}", error).into(), // Own
    }
}

// Before: Vec without capacity
let mut results = Vec::new();
for item in large_collection {
    results.push(process(item));
}

// After: Pre-allocated capacity
let mut results = Vec::with_capacity(large_collection.len());
for item in large_collection {
    results.push(process(item));
}
```

### Types to Implement Copy

```rust
#[derive(Copy, Clone, Debug, PartialEq, Eq)]
pub struct JobId(u64);

#[derive(Copy, Clone, Debug)]
pub enum ExecutionMode {
    Sequential,
    Parallel,
    MapReduce,
}

#[derive(Copy, Clone, Debug)]
pub struct WorkerConfig {
    max_workers: usize,
    timeout_seconds: u64,
}
```

## Dependencies

- **Spec 102**: Executor decomposition enables targeted optimization
- **Spec 104**: MapReduce decomposition exposes optimization opportunities

## Testing Strategy

- Memory usage benchmarks before and after optimization
- Performance regression tests for critical paths
- Property-based tests ensuring correctness after optimization
- Load testing with large datasets to verify improvements
- Profiling integration to catch allocation regressions

## Documentation Requirements

- Document memory optimization patterns in development guide
- Add guidelines for choosing Clone vs Copy
- Document when to use Cow<str> vs String
- Create examples of efficient collection patterns
- Update performance tuning documentation
