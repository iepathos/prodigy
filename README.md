# mmm

A dead simple CLI tool that enables highly configurable and easily manageable self-sufficient Claude development loops.

## What It Does

`mmm` orchestrates self-sufficient Claude development loops that continuously improve your codebase. Run `mmm cook` and it automatically:

1. **Reviews** code with Claude CLI and creates improvement specs
2. **Implements** the improvements by applying fixes to your code
3. **Lints** and formats the code with automated tools
4. **Repeats** until your target iterations is reached

Each iteration is fully autonomous - Claude handles review, implementation, and validation without manual intervention. All changes are committed to git with clear audit trails. Configure workflows to focus on security, performance, testing, or any development aspect you need.

## Installation

```bash
# Clone and build
git clone https://github.com/iepathos/mmm
cd mmm
cargo build --release

# Add to PATH or use directly
./target/release/mmm cook
```

## Usage

### Basic Usage
```bash
# Cook your code to a quality score of 8.0 (default)
mmm cook

# Cook with a specific focus area
mmm cook --focus security

# See detailed progress
mmm cook --verbose

# Combine focus and verbose output
mmm cook --focus performance --verbose
```

### Focus Areas

The `--focus` flag applies to every iteration in your cooking session, ensuring consistent improvement direction:
- **security**: Security vulnerabilities, input validation, authentication
- **performance**: Speed optimizations, memory usage, algorithmic improvements
- **testing**: Test coverage, test quality, edge cases
- **architecture**: Code structure, design patterns, modularity
- **critical**: Only critical issues and bugs
- Custom focus areas based on your project needs

### What Happens (Git-Native Flow)
1. **Project Analysis**: Detects your language (Rust, Python, JS, etc.) and framework
2. **Quality Assessment**: Gives your current code a health score (0-10)
3. **Code Review**: Claude analyzes code and generates improvement specs
4. **Spec Commit**: Creates `specs/temp/iteration-*-improvements.md` and commits it
5. **Implementation**: Applies fixes from the spec and commits changes
6. **Linting**: Runs `cargo fmt`, `clippy --fix`, and `test`, commits if changes
7. **Progress Tracking**: Re-analyzes and repeats until target score is reached

Each step creates git commits for complete auditability.

### Requirements
- [Claude CLI](https://claude.ai/cli) installed and configured
- A project with recognizable code (Rust, Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, etc.)

## Examples

```bash
# Basic cooking run

```

### State Management
- **Git History**: Complete audit trail of all changes through commits
- **Temporary Specs**: `specs/temp/iteration-*-improvements.md` contain exact fixes applied  
- **Simple State**: `.mmm/state.json` tracks basic session info (current score, run count)
- **Project Context**: `.mmm/PROJECT.md`, `ARCHITECTURE.md` provide Claude with project understanding
- All human-readable, git-friendly, no complex databases

### Supported Languages
- **Rust**: Full support with Cargo integration
- **Python**: Basic support with pip/requirements detection
- **JavaScript/TypeScript**: Basic support with npm/package.json
- **Others**: Generic improvements (error handling, documentation, etc.)

## Safety

- **Git-Native**: Every change is a git commit - easy to inspect and revert
- **Automated Testing**: Each iteration runs tests to ensure nothing breaks
- **Incremental**: Makes small, focused improvements rather than large changes
- **Auditable**: Complete paper trail of what was changed and why
- **Validation**: Code is linted and formatted after each change

## Configuration - Flexible Development Loops

`mmm` works out of the box with smart defaults, but its real power comes from customizable workflows that create focused development loops.

### Configurable Workflows

Create a `workflow.yml` file to customize the improvement workflow:

```yaml
# workflow.yml
# Simple YAML format - dead simple and clean
commands:
  - mmm-code-review
  - mmm-implement-spec
  - mmm-lint

max_iterations: 10
```

The default workflow runs these three commands in order:
1. `mmm-code-review` - Analyzes code and generates improvement specs
2. `mmm-implement-spec` - Implements the improvements (spec ID extracted automatically)
3. `mmm-lint` - Runs formatting and linting

You can create custom development loops by combining different Claude commands and focus areas.

#### Focus Arguments

You can specify focus areas for commands using clean YAML syntax:

```yaml
# Security-focused workflow with focus arguments
commands:
  - name: mmm-code-review
    focus: security
  - mmm-implement-spec
  - name: mmm-test-generate
    focus: security
  - mmm-implement-spec
  - mmm-lint

max_iterations: 8
```

Alternative string format also works:
```yaml
commands:
  - mmm-code-review --focus security
  - mmm-implement-spec
  - mmm-lint
```

#### Workflow Examples

**Security-Focused Workflow:**
```yaml
commands:
  - name: mmm-security-audit
    focus: security
  - mmm-implement-spec
  - name: mmm-test-generate
    focus: security
  - mmm-implement-spec
  - mmm-lint
```

**Performance Workflow:**
```yaml
commands:
  - name: mmm-code-review
    focus: performance
  - mmm-implement-spec
  - name: mmm-test-generate
    focus: performance
  - mmm-implement-spec
  - mmm-lint
```

**Quick Fix Workflow:**
```yaml
commands:
  - name: mmm-code-review
    focus: critical
  - mmm-implement-spec
  - mmm-lint

max_iterations: 3
```

### Parallel Sessions with Git Worktrees

Run multiple cooking sessions concurrently without conflicts:

```bash
# Enable worktree mode for this cooking session
mmm cook --worktree --focus "performance"

# In another terminal, run a different cooking focus
mmm cook -w --focus "security"

# List active worktree sessions
mmm worktree list

# Merge improvements back to main branch
mmm worktree merge mmm-performance-1234567890

# Clean up completed worktrees
mmm worktree clean mmm-performance-1234567890
# Or clean all worktrees
mmm worktree clean --all
```

Each session runs in its own git worktree with an isolated branch, allowing multiple cooking efforts to proceed without interfering with each other. Worktrees are stored in `~/.mmm/worktrees/{project-name}/` and are preserved on failure for debugging and automatically suggested for cleanup on success.

## Development

# Lint with claude
claude /mmm-lint

# Run on sample project
cargo run -- cook --verbose
```

## Philosophy

1. **Self-Sufficient Development Loops**: Fully autonomous Claude-driven development cycles that run without manual intervention
2. **Highly Configurable**: Customize workflows to create focused loops for security, performance, testing, or any development aspect
3. **Git-Native**: Use git as the communication layer - simple, reliable, auditable
4. **Dead Simple**: One command to start, minimal options, works immediately
5. **Clear & Minimal**: Focus on enabling powerful development loops without over-engineering

## Limitations

- Requires Claude CLI to be installed and configured
- Works best with well-structured projects
- Limited to improvements Claude CLI can suggest
- No complex workflow or plugin system (by design)

## Contributing

Focus on making the core `mmm cook` command more robust:
- Better language support
- Improved Claude context building
- Enhanced error handling
- Clearer progress feedback

Keep it simple. Keep it working.
