# Workflow to detect and fix documentation drift in the Prodigy book
# This workflow analyzes the codebase and updates book/src/*.md files
# to reflect the latest supported features and syntax.

  # Note: May not commit if features haven't changed since last analysis
  - claude: "/prodigy-analyze-features-for-book --project $PROJECT_NAME --config $PROJECT_CONFIG"

  # Step 2: Detect documentation gaps and create missing chapters/subsections

  # NOTE: organize_chapters.py has been removed from the workflow because:
  # 1. It was creating over-fragmented subsections with minimal content
  # 2. It doesn't migrate existing content into new subsections
  # 3. Phase 7.5 in /prodigy-detect-documentation-gaps now handles structure validation
  # 4. Manual chapter organization is more appropriate for documentation quality
  #
  # If you need to organize a large chapter into subsections:
  # - Use /prodigy-migrate-chapter-to-subsections manually
  # - Or let /prodigy-detect-documentation-gaps create properly validated subsections

  # Clean up temporary analysis files (keep validation report for review)
  - shell: "rm -rf ${ANALYSIS_DIR}/features.json ${ANALYSIS_DIR}/flattened-items.json ${ANALYSIS_DIR}/drift-*.json"
